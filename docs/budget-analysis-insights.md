## 💡 ATL/BTL Ratio Analysis

### Industry Standard Discovered

Professional budgets follow a remarkably consistent pattern:

```
ATL (Above-the-Line):    ~20% of total budget
BTL (Below-the-Line):    ~80% of total budget

Standard Ratio: 1:4.03
```

This means **for every $1 spent on talent/creatives, $4.03 goes to crew/production**.

### ATL Percentage by Location

| Location | ATL % | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Los Angeles | 17.8% | Established talent, favorable deals |
| Chicago | 18.7% | Union market compression |
| Boston | 19.1% | Balanced allocation |
| Pittsburgh | 19.6% | Standard allocation |
| New Orleans | 19.7% | Standard allocation |
| Atlanta | 19.7% | Standard allocation |
| Wilmington, NC | 19.9% | Standard allocation |
| Charleston, SC | 20.7% | Slightly talent-heavy |
| **Vancouver** | **23.8%** | **Highest ATL** - Canadian talent premium |

### AI Application: Budget Validation

We can now build AI features that:
- **Flag unusual ratios:** "Your ATL is 30%, typical is 20%. Consider reducing talent costs."
- **Suggest adjustments:** "Move $500K from ATL to BTL to match industry standards."
- **Location-specific guidance:** "Vancouver budgets typically allocate 24% to ATL."

## 📈 Budget Size Distribution

### Categories Identified

| Category | Count | Avg Budget | Typical Use Case |
|----------|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Small (<$3M)** | 1 | $1.84M | Multi-camera sitcom pattern budget |
| **Medium ($3-6M)** | 5 | $4.83M | Cable series, limited series |
| **Large (>$6M)** | 27 | $6.94M | One-hour drama pilots, premium cable |

### Production Type Patterns

From filenames and budget structures:

**Multi-Camera Series**
- $3.9M total (amortization) ÷ 12 episodes = $325K per episode
- $1.84M pattern budget (per-episode view)
- Lower costs: stage shooting, smaller crew, shorter shoot days

**One-Hour Drama Pilots**
- Range: $6.5M - $7.5M depending on location
- 15-20 shoot days typical
- Location-based, larger crew (3x vs multi-cam)

**Cable Series**
- $5.6M for 9 episodes = $622K per episode
- Use DGA/IATSE sideletter rates (15-25% lower)
- Lower ATL spending (3.7% observed vs 15-25% network)

---

### 6. Predictive Variance Alerts 🔄 FUTURE

**Data Needed:** Actual vs budget tracking (Phase 3)

**Concept:**
```
Mid-production alert:

⚠️ Camera Department Trending Over Budget

Budgeted: 10 shoot days × $12K/day = $120K
Actual (Day 7): 8 days spent, $108K used
Projection: Will need 12 days (2 days over)
Impact: +$24K over budget

Cause Analysis:
- Weather delays: 2 days lost
- Atlanta had similar rain issues in March 2021

Recommendations:
1. Reduce post-production by 2 days (-$18K)
2. Request contingency increase (+$24K)
3. Accelerate remaining schedule (risky)
```

## 📋 Phase 2 Implementation Roadmap

Based on this analysis of **33 real budgets**, here are the priority features:

### ✅ IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Start Now)

#### 1. Multi-Period Time Tracking [HIGH]
**Why:** ALL professional budgets break costs into Prep/Shoot/Hiatus/Wrap
**Impact:** Enables accurate per-period cost modeling
**Complexity:** Medium (database + UI changes)

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE budget_line_items ADD COLUMN periods JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "prep": {"days": 0, "hours_per_day": 0, "rate": 0},
  "shoot": {"days": 0, "hours_per_day": 0, "rate": 0},
  "hiatus": {"days": 0, "hours_per_day": 0, "rate": 0},
  "wrap": {"days": 0, "hours_per_day": 0, "rate": 0},
  "holiday": {"days": 0, "hours_per_day": 0, "rate": 0}
}';
```

#### 2. Location Comparison Tool [HIGH]
**Why:** Can save productions $500K-$1.9M by choosing right location
**Impact:** Massive cost savings, clear competitive advantage
**Complexity:** Medium (new UI, analysis algorithms)

**Implementation:**
- New page: `/productions/[id]/compare-locations`
- Load 33 budgets as comparison database
- Calculate estimates based on user's production type
- Apply tax incentive calculations
- Show side-by-side results

#### 3. Box Rental Caps [MEDIUM]
**Why:** Observed in all professional budgets
**Impact:** Accurate cost calculations
**Complexity:** Low (simple cap logic)

**Implementation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE budget_line_items ADD COLUMN box_rental JSONB DEFAULT '{
  "weekly_rate": 0,
  "weeks": 0,
  "cap_amount": 1000,
  "total": 0,
  "capped_total": 0
}';
```

---

### 🔄 SECONDARY PRIORITIES (After Phase 2)

#### 4. Budget Templates by Location [MEDIUM]
**Data:** 6 Atlanta budgets, 4 LA, 4 Chicago, 2 each for 6 other locations
**Feature:** Pre-populate budgets based on location + type

#### 5. ATL/BTL Validation Alerts [MEDIUM]
**Standard:** 20% ATL / 80% BTL discovered
**Feature:** Real-time warnings when ratio deviates

#### 6. Fringe Breakdown Display [LOW]
**Why:** Professional budgets show detailed fringe components
**Feature:** Expandable fringe section per line item

---

## 🎬 Professional Budget Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: Amortization vs Pattern Budgets

**Amortization Budget:**
- Shows ALL series costs (prep + wrap + all episodes)
- Example: $3.9M ÷ 12 episodes = $325K per episode
- Used for: Series financing, network deals

**Pattern Budget:**
- Shows SINGLE typical episode cost
- Includes amortization line item (allocated share)
- Example: $1.84M per episode
- Used for: Episode tracking, variance analysis

**System Implication:** Need toggle between "Series Total" and "Per Episode" views

---

### Pattern 2: Multi-Period Calculation Formula

**Every line item uses:**
```
Amount × Units × Hours × Rate = Subtotal

Example - Script Coordinator:
  Prep:    40 days × 14 hrs × $26.15 = $14,644
  Shoot:   60 days × 14 hrs × $26.15 = $21,966
  Hiatus:  20 days × 14 hrs × $26.15 = $7,322
  Wrap:    10 days × 14 hrs × $26.15 = $3,661
  Total: $47,593
```

---

### Pattern 3: Platform-Specific Rate Tiers

**Same Union, Different Rates:**
- **Network/Broadcast:** Highest rates (standard DGA/IATSE)
- **Cable:** 15-25% lower (DGA Sideletter rates)
- **SVOD/Streaming:** Varies by platform and budget tier
- **Low Budget:** Special agreements (<$2.6M)

**Evidence from Data:**
- Cable series: $5.6M (9 eps) = $622K/ep
- Network pilot: $6.5M (1 ep)
- Cable uses lower ATL% (observed 3.7% in one budget)

---

### Pattern 4: Location Iteration Process

**Discovered:** Budgets go through 1-6 versions per location

Example - Atlanta:
- Ver 01: Initial estimate
- Ver 02: +$8,500 (crew adjustments)
- Ver 03: +$2,200 (fringe corrections)
- Ver 04-06: Minor tweaks (<$5K changes)

**Insight:** Professional budgeting is iterative, not one-shot

**AI Feature:** Version control and change tracking built-in
