--- PAGE 6 of 71 ---

with the Health Plan's consultants, determine, taking into account the costs
of such thirteenth and fourteenth checks, that: (i) at least eight (8) months
of reserves exist in each of the Active Employees Fund and the Retired
Employees Fund at that time; (ii) the Plan is certified to be in the Green
Zone in the calendar year in which the check(s) are paid; (iii) the cost of

Modify Article XIII.(f)(1) of the Basic Agreement as follows:
“(f) (1) Contingent Pension Benefit Increase(s) Effective January 1,
20242027 and Every Three (3) Years Thereafter
“The bargaining parties agree to recommend to the Directors of the
Pension Plan the following pension benefit increase(s):
“As soon as practicable following the end of the first
quarter of 20242027 and every three years thereafter (‘the evaluation
year’), the Health Plan's consultants, in conjunction with the Pension
Plan's actuaries, shall determine whether each of the Active Health Fund
and the Retired Employees Fund has at least eight (8) months of reserves
as of January 1st of the evaluation year, and the Pension Plan's actuaries
shall determine whether to certify that the Pension Plan is in the Green
Zone in the evaluation year. The foregoing determinations shall be based

00317375.DOCX; 14 4

--- PAGE 7 of 71 ---

funding priorities established for Supplemental Markets and Post '60s
contributions, approved by the bargaining parties.

each of the Active Health Fund and the Retired Employees Fund has at
least eight (8) months of reserves on January 1st of the evaluation year,
and the Pension Plan's actuaries certify that the Pension Plan is in the

those individuals who had a Break in Service during the three (3) year
period immediately preceding January 1st of the evaluation year, the
increase shall apply only to Credited Hours accumulated after the date of
the most recent Break in Service. (For example, an active participant in
the Pension Plan on January 1, 20242027 who failed to accumulate at least
two hundred (200) Vested Hours in 20212024 and 20222025 is entitled to
the ten percent (10%)fifteen percent (15%) increase only for those
Credited Hours accumulated on or after January 1, 20232026.) Any
retroactive payments required above shall be made without interest and as
soon as practicable following the consultants’ certifications as provided
above.”

Plan participant who is covered by another collective bargaining
agreement, unless such collective bargaining agreement contains this
pension and health package on an equivalent economic basis.

e. High Budget SVOD Primary Market Contribution, Performance Metric
Bonus Contribution and Secondary Market Contribution
Add a new Article to the Basic Agreement to provide as follows:
“[ ] Reuse of High Budget SVOD Programs
“For purposes of this Article [ ], ‘High Budget SVOD Programs’ are
defined as original and derivative dramatic new media productions made for
initial exhibition on a subscription video-on-demand consumer pay platform
which meet the following ‘high budget’ criteria:
“Length of Program ‘High Budget’ Threshold
as Initially Exhibited*
“20-35 Minutes $1,300,000 and above
“36-65 Minutes $2,500,000 and above
“66 Minutes or more $3,000,000 and above
“* Programs less than 20 minutes are not considered “high budget” for the
purpose of this Article, regardless of their budgets.
“Only those covered High Budget SVOD Programs on which two (2) or
more ‘employees employed by Producer under this Agreement,’ as that term is
used in Article XIX(a) and in Article XXVIII(a)(2) of the Basic Agreement,[ ] are
so employed shall generate residual payments and then only in accordance with
the following. It is understood that any such High Budget SVOD Program, High
Budget SVOD mini-series or season of a High Budget SVOD series which
commences principal photography during the term of the 2024 Basic Agreement
shall be governed by the residual formulas set forth in this subparagraph (a) of the
2024 Basic Agreement in perpetuity.
“(a) High Budget SVOD Programs Subject to a Primary Market
Contribution
“(1) The provisions of this subparagraph (a) apply to the
following live action High Budget SVOD Programs:
“(i) any new season of a live action High Budget SVOD
series for which principal photography of the first episode of the season
commences on or after [August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the business
day that the AMPTP receives notification of ratification, whichever is later];
[ ] It is understood and agreed that any employee employed under the terms of the corresponding ‘Productions Made
for New Media’ Sideletter in either the Local #52 Agreement or in the Local #161 Agreement shall not be
considered an ‘employee employed under this Agreement’ for purposes of this Article [ ].
00317375.DOCX; 14 6

--- PAGE 9 of 71 ---

“(ii) any live action High Budget SVOD mini-series for
which principal photography of the first part of such mini-series commences on or
after [August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the business day that the
AMPTP receives notification of ratification, whichever is later]; and
“(iii) one-time live action High Budget SVOD programs
which commence principal photography on or after [August 4, 2024 or the first
Sunday following the business day that the AMPTP receives notification of
ratification, whichever is later].
“(2) The Producer shall have the right to use a one-time live
action High Budget SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-series and season
of a High Budget SVOD series on all subscription video-on-demand consumer
pay platforms worldwide for a period commencing with the initial availability of
the Program on any such platform and continuing for ninety (90) consecutive days
thereafter in the case of a one-time Program; ninety (90) consecutive days after
the initial exhibition of the last part of the mini-series in the case of a mini-series;
and ninety (90) consecutive days after the initial exhibition of the last episode of
the season in the case of a series) (‘Initial Exhibition Period’), without payment of
residuals for such use.
“(3) In the event that the Producer makes available the one-time
live action High Budget SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-series or
season of the High Budget SVOD series on any subscription video-on-demand
consumer pay platform beyond the Initial Exhibition Period defined in
subparagraph (a)(2) above, the Producer shall make a payment to the Motion
Picture Industry Health Plan (such payment hereinafter referred to as the ‘High
Budget SVOD Primary Market Contribution’) for each Exhibition Year, as set
forth below. Payment of the applicable High Budget SVOD Primary Market
Contribution for each Exhibition Year shall cover a fifty-two (52) consecutive
week period of use of the one-time High Budget SVOD Program, mini-series or
season of the series on all subscription video-on-demand consumer pay platforms
worldwide, commencing upon expiration of the Initial Exhibition Period or upon
commencement of the subsequent Exhibition Year, as applicable.
00317375.DOCX; 14 7

--- PAGE 10 of 71 ---

“The applicable High Budget SVOD Primary Market
Contribution shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of hours for
which hourly contributions were due for employees employed under this
Agreement on such one-time High Budget SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD
mini-series or season of the High Budget SVOD series by the applicable
Exhibition Year contribution rate set forth below:
Exhibition Year Contribution Rate
Year 1 Two dollars ($2.00) per hour
Year 2 One dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per hour
Year 3 Seventy-five cents ($0.75) per hour
Year 4 Fifty cents ($0.50) per hour
Year 5 Ten cents ($0.10) per hour
Year 6 Five cents ($0.05) per hour
Year 7 Five cents ($0.05) per hour
Year 8 Five cents ($0.05) per hour
Year 9 Three and one-half cents ($0.035) per hour
Year 10 Three and one-half cents ($0.035) per hour
Year 11 Three and one-half cents ($0.035) per hour
Year 12 Three and one-half cents ($0.035) per hour
Each Exhibition Two cents ($0.02) per hour
Year Thereafter
“If fewer than all episodes of the season of the High Budget
SVOD series are made available for exhibition during any Exhibition Year after
the first, payment of the High Budget SVOD Primary Market Contribution shall
be calculated based upon the total number of hours for which hourly contributions
were due for employees employed under this Agreement on those episodes which
are made available for exhibition.
“(4) Exhibition Year 1 as provided in subparagraph (a)(3) above
shall commence on the first day that the one-time High Budget SVOD Program,
the High Budget SVOD mini-series or the season of the High Budget SVOD
series, as applicable, is made available for exhibition on any subscription video-
on-demand consumer pay platform after the conclusion of the Initial Exhibition
Period defined in subparagraph (a)(2) above. Payment therefor shall be due
within sixty (60) calendar days following the close of the calendar quarter in
which Exhibition Year 1 commenced.
“Each Exhibition Year thereafter as provided in
subparagraph (a)(3) above shall commence with the first day that the one-time
High Budget SVOD Program, the High Budget SVOD mini-series or the season
of the High Budget SVOD series, as applicable, is made available for exhibition
on any subscription consumer pay platform following the expiration of the prior
Exhibition Year. Payment therefor shall be due within sixty (60) calendar days
00317375.DOCX; 14 8

--- PAGE 11 of 71 ---

following the close of the calendar quarter in which such Exhibition Year
commenced.
“Payment of the foregoing amounts covers all uses of the
one-time live action High Budget SVOD Program, live action High Budget
SVOD mini-series or season of the live action High Budget SVOD series in all
markets in perpetuity, except as otherwise provided in this Article [ ].
“(5) ‘Performance-Metric’ Bonus Contribution
“The following applies to a one-time live action High
Budget SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-series and season of a High
Budget SVOD series that is eligible for a High Budget SVOD Primary Market
Contribution pursuant to Article [ ], subparagraph (a) above.
“Producer shall make an additional contribution to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan for each one-time live action High Budget
SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-series or season of a High Budget
SVOD series that has a ‘performance metric’ (see definition in subparagraph (i)
below) of twenty percent (20%) or more on the SVOD service for which it was
made (‘SVOD Service’).
“(i) Definition of ‘Performance Metric’[ ]
“The ‘performance metric’ is calculated by dividing
the total number of ‘domestic views’ (see definition in subparagraph (ii) below)
by the total number of domestic subscribers.[ ]
“Performance Metric = # Domestic Views
# Domestic Subscribers
[ ] Producer may rely on the determination by the SVOD Service whether eligibility for the ‘performance
metric’ has been met for any covered High Budget SVOD Program. Subparagraph (vi) is the sole mechanism for the
Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan to verify information about the ‘performance-metric’ bonus or its calculation.
[ ] For purposes of determining the ‘performance metric’ bonus contribution, the SVOD Service shall
determine the number of domestic subscribers as of July 1st of each year of the Agreement. The SVOD Service
shall apply that number when the one-time live action High Budget SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-
series or season of a High Budget SVOD series is first made available on the SVOD Service on or after July 1st of
the measuring year but not later than June 30th of the following year. Likewise, the SVOD Service shall make a
separate determination of the number of domestic subscribers for each subsequent Exhibition Year as of July 1st of
each year of the Agreement by applying that number on the first day that the one-time live action High Budget
SVOD Program, High Budget SVOD mini-series or season of a High Budget SVOD series is made available in any
second or subsequent Exhibition Year on or after July 1st of the measuring year but no later than June 30th of the
following year. For example, if an SVOD Service has 25 million domestic subscribers as of July 1, 2023 and makes
the first episode of the first season of a High Budget SVOD series available on March 1, 2024, the applicable
number of domestic subscribers is 25 million for purposes of calculating the ‘performance metric’ bonus for that
season of the series.
00317375.DOCX; 14 9

--- PAGE 12 of 71 ---

“(ii) Definition of ‘Domestic Views’
“The number of ‘domestic views’ of a live action
High Budget SVOD mini-series or season of a live action High Budget SVOD
series is calculated by dividing the total hours streamed domestically during the
first ninety (90) days after each episode in the season of a live action High Budget
SVOD series or each part of a live action High Budget SVOD mini-series is made
available on the SVOD Service by the total runtime of all episodes in the season
or all parts of a mini-series.
“For a one-time live action High Budget SVOD
Program, the number of ‘domestic views’ is calculated by dividing the total hours
streamed domestically on the SVOD Service during the first ninety (90) days after
the one-time live action High Budget SVOD Program is made available on the
SVOD Service by the total runtime of the one-time live action High Budget
SVOD Program.
“(Both the hours streamed and the runtime are
determined by rounding to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) hour.)
“Views = Total Hours Streamed Domestically in 1st 90 Days
Total Runtime (in hours)
“(iii) Subsequent Year Eligibility
“Eligibility for the ‘performance-metric’ bonus
contribution shall also be determined for each subsequent Exhibition Year as
defined in Paragraph (a)(3) above. The formula for determining eligibility is the
same as provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, except that the total hours
streamed are counted for the first ninety (90) days of the subsequent Exhibition
Year.
“(iv) If the ‘performance metric’ is met, the Producer
shall make an additional payment of one hundred percent (100%) of the High
Budget SVOD Primary Market Contribution for the applicable Exhibition Year to
the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan.
“Payment of the ‘performance-metric’ bonus
contribution shall be due sixty (60) days after the end of the calendar quarter in
which the ninety (90) day measuring period for domestic views is complete.
“(v) Example: Program XYZ is a High Budget SVOD
series with ten (10) episodes in its second season that are each 35 minutes in
length. Principal photography for the second season commenced on or after
[August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the business day that the AMPTP
receives notification of ratification, whichever is later]. At all relevant times, the
SVOD Service has fifty million (50,000,000) domestic subscribers. Collectively,
all episodes of the second season of Program XYZ had seventy million
00317375.DOCX; 14 10

--- PAGE 13 of 71 ---

(70,000,000) hours streamed domestically in the first ninety (90) days after the
episodes were made available on the SVOD Service.
“To determine whether the second season of
Program XYZ qualifies for a ‘performance-metric’ bonus contribution in its first
Exhibition Year, the total number of domestic views is determined by dividing the
total number of domestic hours streamed (seventy million (70,000,000) hours) of
all episodes in the second season by the total runtime in hours (5.8 hours rounded
as provided herein) of the second season. The ‘performance metric’ is then
determined by dividing the total number of domestic views (70 million/5.8 hours)
by the total number of domestic subscribers (50 million).
“Domestic Views = Total Domestic Hours Streamed = 70M
Total Runtime (in hours) 5.8
“Performance Metric = Domestic Views
Total Number of Domestic Subscribers
“= [70M hours ÷ 5.8 hours] ÷ 50M domestic subscribers
“= 0.241 (or 24.1%), which is greater than the twenty percent
(20%) threshold for payment and would, therefore, trigger payment
of the ‘performance-metric’ bonus contribution.
“Producer shall make an additional contribution in the amount of
100% of the High Budget SVOD Primary Market Contribution that
applies to Exhibition Year 1 of the second season of Program XYZ
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan.
“(vi) Should the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan
provide written notice to the SVOD Service and the Producer that it disputes
whether a covered High Budget SVOD Program qualifies for a ‘performance-
metric’ bonus contribution, the dispute shall be submitted promptly to a third
party jointly chosen by the SVOD Service and the Motion Picture Industry
Pension Plan for determination by audit (or other procedure determined by the
third party) (hereafter ‘audit’). The audit shall be for the sole purpose of verifying
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan, the SVOD Service and the Producer
whether the one-time live action High Budget SVOD Program, High Budget
SVOD mini-series or season of a High Budget SVOD series is entitled to a
performance-metric bonus contribution (‘yes/no’). The third party must execute a
confidentiality agreement approved by the SVOD Service. The Motion Picture
Industry Pension Plan and the SVOD Service shall evenly split the costs and fees
associated with any such audit. The Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and the
IATSE shall not be entitled to obtain information about the number of domestic
subscribers, the hours streamed domestically, the running time or the
‘performance metric’ of the High Budget SVOD Program.
00317375.DOCX; 14 11

--- PAGE 14 of 71 ---

“The Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan retains
any and all rights to pursue a claim should a Producer fail to pay the performance-
metric bonus contribution within sixty (60) days after the third party confirms that
such a bonus is due.
“(6) Reuse on Free-to-the-Consumer Advertiser-Supported New
Media Platforms, Free Ad-Supported Streaming Television (FAST) Channels,
Free Television or Basic Cable
“Producer shall have the right to use a High Budget SVOD
Program on any free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported new media platform,
free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channel, free television or basic
cable without the payment of residuals for a ninety (90) consecutive day period,
commencing with the first day of use of the High Budget SVOD Program on a
free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported new media platform, free ad-supported
streaming television (FAST) channel, free television or basic cable.
“If the Producer uses the High Budget SVOD Program on a
free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported new media platform, free ad-supported
streaming television (FAST) channel, free television or basic cable beyond such
ninety (90) consecutive day period, then Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture
Industry Health Plan 5.4% of the ‘Producer’s gross’ realized from any license
which includes use on any such platform beyond the ninety (90) consecutive day
period referred to above. Payment for such exhibition shall be due sixty (60) days
after the end of the calendar quarter in which the ninety (90) consecutive day
period ended.

13. Artificial Intelligence
a. Add a new Article to the IATSE Basic Agreement to provide as follows:
“[XLIX]. Artificial Intelligence
“This Article [XLIX] applies prospectively on or after [insert the date that
is the first Sunday that is August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the
business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is
later].
“(a) Definitions
“The parties acknowledge that ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and ‘AI’
have become catchall names that generally refer to the ability of a machine-based
system to apply analysis and logic-based techniques to solve problems or perform
tasks and improve as it analyzes more data. An ‘AI System’ is any machine-
based system that uses AI as a core function.
“(1) Machine Learning. The parties acknowledge that machine
learning (‘ML’) is a subset of AI that enables machines to develop algorithms,
including via deep learning (as defined below), based on statistical inferences
drawn from patterns in submitted training data, including, but not limited to,
diffusion models and large language models, for the purpose of performing tasks.
Such tasks include, but are not limited to, predicting human behaviors,
disseminating information and generating content.
“(2) Generative Artificial Intelligence. The parties acknowledge
that generative artificial intelligence (‘Gen AI’) refers to a subset of ML that
generates new content including, but not limited to, text, video, audio, three-
dimensional (3D) models, code, and images. A ‘Gen AI System’ is any machine-
based system that uses Gen AI as a core function.
“(3) Deep Learning. The parties acknowledge that deep learning
refers to a subset of ML based on artificial neural networks that have multiple
layers of connected artificial neuron nodes processing data.
“(4) The terms ‘Gen AI’ and ‘Deep Learning’ are used for
convenience and this provision shall also apply to any technology that is
consistent with the foregoing definitions, regardless of its name or designation.
“(b) Existing Technologies and Practices
“The parties acknowledge that the Producers have historically
used digital technologies, including without limitation so-called ‘traditional AI’
technologies programmed to perform specific functions (e.g., CGI, VFX, sound
effects), and technologies such as those used during any stage of pre-
00317375.DOCX; 14 38

--- PAGE 41 of 71 ---

visualization, pre-production, production, post-production, marketing and
distribution and may continue to do so, consistent with their historical practices.
“(c) New Technologies and Practices
“(1) The parties acknowledge the importance of human
contributions in motion pictures and the need to address the potential impact of
the use of AI Systems on employment under the Basic Agreement, the Videotape
Electronics Supplemental Basic Agreement and the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements (collectively, the ‘Agreements’).
“(2) Use of New Technologies
“(i) A Producer continues to have the right to utilize
new technologies in connection with motion picture production, including in
connection with creative elements. Producer may require employees to use any
AI System1 or resulting output of such systems for use in connection with the
performance of covered work. Employees who are assigned to utilize an AI
System to perform services, including by inputting prompts or otherwise
overseeing the use of the AI System, shall continue to be covered under the terms
of the applicable Agreement while performing such work.
“(ii) The Producer will not require an employee to
provide prompts furnished by the employee in the performance of bargaining unit
work in a manner that results in the displacement of any covered employee.
“(iii) Should an employee use AI Systems in the
performance of covered work, the employee will be required to adhere to the
Producer’s policies (e.g., policies related to ethics, privacy, security,
copyrightability or other protection of intellectual property rights), which shall be
provided to the employee. In any event, the Producer retains the right to require
that an employee obtain consent from the Producer before using AI Systems, and
Producer retains the right to reject the use of AI Systems or any output from such
use, including when the use could adversely affect the copyrightability or
exploitation of the work or create other risks or liabilities for the Producer.
Producer agrees to provide the International Union with any written policies
governing the use of AI Systems by employees covered under this Agreement.
“A Producer’s decision to require an employee to
use an AI System in connection with the employee’s performance of bargaining
unit work, including for any creative elements or administrative tasks, will be
subject to consultation with the employee at the employee’s request, provided
that the requirements of production allow time for the consultation.
1 Should the Producer agree to use an employee’s own AI System, Producer and employee shall negotiate for
reasonable reimbursement for such use.
00317375.DOCX; 14 39

--- PAGE 42 of 71 ---

“(iv) The Producer shall indemnify the employee from
liability and necessary costs, including by providing the employee a legal defense
resulting from any claims arising from the use of AI Systems or the resulting
output occurring in the performance of the employee’s duties and within the
scope of the employee’s employment with Producer, subject to the conditions
that:
“(A) This subparagraph (iv) shall not apply in
any instance in which the injury, loss or damage is the result of or caused by, in
whole or in part, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such employee;
“(B) Employee is not in breach of the
Producer’s policies which have been disclosed to the employee and the employee
has made appropriate disclosure of the use of AI Systems to the Producer;
“(C) Immediately upon the employee and/or the
Union being informed of any claim or litigation, the employee and/or the Union
shall notify Producer thereof and give Producer full details of any claim or the
institution of any action for which the employee seeks indemnification under this
subparagraph, including by delivering to the Producer every demand, notice,
summons, complaint or other process received;
“(D) Producer shall name or cover the employee
as an additional insured on its errors and omissions policies, if any, respecting
motion pictures; and
“(E) The employee shall cooperate fully in the
defense of any claim for which indemnification is provided in this subparagraph
(iv), including the attending of hearings and trials, securing and giving evidence
and obtaining the attendance of witnesses.
“(d) Implementation of Work Training Programs
“(1) The parties acknowledge that the preferred method of
addressing impact resulting from new technologies is through provision of work
training and other programs designed to foster new skills to improve
opportunities for employment and effective use of AI tools. The parties agree to
cooperate in the establishment of work training and other programs with respect
to covered work under applicable Agreements. A committee will be convened for
the purpose of formulating and implementing such training and other programs.
The training and other programs shall be designed in cooperation between the
parties and shall be focused on training employees in (A) skills required to
operate AI Systems associated with the employee’s current work classification
and/or (B) new skills required to transition to other classifications of work
covered by applicable Agreements. The parties agree that the committee shall
meet within ninety (90) days of contract ratification.
00317375.DOCX; 14 40

--- PAGE 43 of 71 ---

“(2) [Discussion of funding mechanism for training through
IATTF and CSATF.]
“(e) Ongoing Obligations
“(1) Joint Industry-Wide Meetings. The parties agree to meet at
least semi-annually during the term of the Agreements at the request of the
International Union to discuss and review information related to the Producers’
use and intended use of AI Systems in the production of motion pictures covered
under applicable Agreements, to the extent that such information has been made
publicly available. Topics for the meeting shall be identified in advance.
“(2) Each Producer agrees to meet quarterly with the
International Union, on a company-by-company basis, during the term of the
respective Agreements, at the request of the International Union. At such
meeting, Producer will identify any significant emerging technologies utilizing
AI Systems that the Producer is using or intends to use in motion picture
production which may affect persons covered by these Agreements. Because
Producer’s current and future technology may be discussed during these
meetings, and in order to protect Producer’s proprietary and/or confidential
information, trade secrets and intellectual property, the International Union
agrees that its representatives participating in these meetings will be limited to a
reasonable number of individuals (i.e., not to exceed eight [8]) representing
bargaining units for which the topics identified in advance to be discussed are
relevant, and each participating representative will execute a mutually agreed-
upon Confidentiality Agreement.
“(3) Topics for discussion at the meetings described in
subparagraphs (1) and (2) above may, in addition to other topics related to AI
Systems as proposed in advance of the meeting, include:
“(i) the extent to which jobs may have been affected as
a result of the use of AI Systems;
“(ii) physical safety protocols involving the use in work
environments of AI-controlled equipment including the use of AI-controlled
autonomous vehicles and/or robots;
“(iii) efforts to ensure that use(s) of AI Systems mitigate
against bias; and
“(iv) possible unique aspects of training for upskilling or
reskilling, in connection with subparagraph (d) above, of experienced bargaining
unit employees.
“(f) Claims for violation of this Article are arbitrable and must be
brought under this Agreement. All remedies are available with the exception of
00317375.DOCX; 14 41

--- PAGE 44 of 71 ---

injunctive relief. For clarity, the arbitrator shall have no authority to prohibit or
restrict the use of any AI System or the resulting outputs.
“(g) Except as explicitly set forth herein, it is understood that this
Article does not expand or contract any existing rights and obligations under
applicable Agreements. Nothing herein alters the scope of coverage under those
Agreements.
“(h) No employee shall be subject to scanning of their visual or vocal
likeness for use in a motion picture without the employee’s consent. Producer
shall provide the employee with a reasonably specific description of the intended
use. The consent must be clear and conspicuous and may be obtained through an
endorsement or statement in the employment contract that is separately signed or
initialed by the employee or in a separate writing that is signed by the employee.
A copy of the consent shall be provided to the Union in advance of it being
presented to employees. The employee’s consent to such scanning may not be a
condition of employment and the consent itself shall clearly state the same.”
b. Add a Sideletter to the Basic Agreement to provide as follows:
“During the 2024 negotiations, the parties reached agreement to add a new Article
XLIX to the Basic Agreement to address the Producer’s right to use new
technologies, including artificial intelligence and AI Systems (as those terms are
defined therein), in connection with motion picture production. Article XLIX was
the result of extensive discussions between the parties, including with their
respective experts, and calls for regular meetings between the parties during the
term to keep the Union advised and informed of developments in the use of AI
Systems affecting bargaining unit members. The parties acknowledge both the
Producer’s right to use new technologies involving AI System(s) in Article XLIX
and the Producer’s obligation, upon request of the Union, to negotiate over any
impact of such use on bargaining unit employees as required by law.
“Under the Basic Agreement, Producers may have additional obligations, and
other dispute resolution provisions may apply, under the ‘Technological Change’
clauses in many of the West Coast Studio Local Agreements as the result of the
introduction of an AI System. Should that be the case, those clauses, including
the protections provided therein, shall apply to employees working under those
Agreements in addition to the provisions of this Sideletter and Article XLIX.
“Understanding that Producers may adopt technological changes attributable to
AI System(s) under West Coast Studio Local Agreements that do not contain a
‘Technological Change’ clause, the parties agreed during the 2024 negotiations
that the ‘Technological Change’ clauses, as they exist in other West Coast Studio
Local Agreements, shall apply, in addition to the provisions of this Sideletter and
Article XLIX, to all technological changes that may result from the introduction
of an AI System.
00317375.DOCX; 14 42

--- PAGE 45 of 71 ---

“The parties confirm that a Producer may experiment with using an AI System for
the primary purpose of determining, under operating conditions, the feasibility
and/or adequacy of performance of any AI System and may test the AI System
under operating conditions by persons under the jurisdiction of the Basic
Agreement on a temporary basis. Those circumstances do not constitute a
technological change or otherwise impose any obligation on Producer, other than
those specifically set forth in Article XLIX to the Basic Agreement.”
14. Safety Officer Pilot Program
The Producers agree to implement a pilot program in New York and Georgia modeled on
California tax incentive legislation (California SB735) as follows during the period July
1, 2025 to and including June 30, 2026:
As part of that pilot program, each of the major studios shall identify at least one (1)
dramatic production of 75 minutes or longer in each state (to the extent the major studio
has a production shooting in that state) to participate in the pilot program. A dedicated,
qualified safety officer shall be engaged to conduct a risk assessment for the production
and shall be present on each day to implement the risk assessment.
It is understood that any production(s) chosen to participate in this pilot program may
also serve as the participating production under other collective bargaining agreements
containing similar obligations and that any production(s) chosen to participate in
analogous pilot program(s) under other collective bargaining agreements may conversely
serve as pilot program(s) under the IATSE Basic Agreement.
15. Vacations
Create a new footnote in Paragraph 72(e)(1) (“Vacations”) of the West Coast Studio
Local Agreements as follows:
“The term ‘eligible year’ shall be applied in the following manner with respect to
calendar year 2023: As to calendar year 2023 only, an employee shall be deemed to have
an ‘eligible year’ if the employee has worked at least forty (40) days.”
16. Severance Pay
a. Modify Paragraph 74(a)(1) of the West Coast Studio Local Agreements (and
Paragraph 19 of the Local 871 (Production Office Coordinator, Assistant
Production Office Coordinator, Art Department Coordinator) Agreement,
Paragraph 30 of the Local 871 Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room Assistants
Agreement and Paragraph 3(a)(28)(E) of the Local 700 Majors and Independents
Amendment Agreements) as follows:
“(1) (i) An employee employed by the Producer under this
Agreement or its predecessor agreements for one or more qualified years (as

defined in subparagraph (f) hereof) whose employment is severed after August 1,
20212024; or
“(ii) an employee who had at least one (1) qualified year (as
defined in Paragraph 74(f) of this Agreement) as of August 1, 1985 who has made
the required application for retirement to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
Plan at least sixty (60) days prior to retiring or has made the required application
for retirement to any private retirement plan referred to in Article XV of the Trust
Agreement of the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and who retires
“shall receive the applicable severance pay set forth below (as modified by
subparagraphs (c) and (d) hereof) unless such employee is disqualified for
severance pay purposes pursuant to subparagraph (e) hereof.

“An employee with twelve (12) or more qualified years, whose employment is
severed on or after [insert date that is August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following
the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is
later] or whose retirement date is on or after [insert date that is August 4, 2024 or
the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice
of ratification, whichever is later], shall receive an additional twenty-five percent
(25%) of the applicable severance pay set forth above.
“The rate at which severance pay is payable shall be
determined in the same manner as the rate at which vacation pay is determined
under the vacation pay provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
base period used in computing the employee's average earnings shall, for the
00317375.DOCX; 14 44

--- PAGE 47 of 71 ---

purpose of severance pay, be based on the twelve (12) consecutive month period
ending on the date of severance, instead of the employee's personal income tax
earnings year used in computing vacation pay.”
b. Add a footnote to the definition of a “qualified year” in Paragraph 74(f) of the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements (and Paragraph 19(e) of the Local 871
(Production Office Coordinator, Assistant Production Office Coordinator, Art
Department Coordinator) Agreement, Paragraph 30(e) of the Local 871 Script
Coordinators and Writers’ Room Assistants Agreement and Paragraphs
3(a)(28)(E) of the Local 700 Majors and Independents Amendment Agreements),
as follows:
“Effective [insert date that is August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the
business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is
later], the definition of a ‘qualified year,’ for purposes of Paragraph 74(f), shall
be applied in the following manner with respect to calendar year 2023: As to
calendar year 2023 only, an employee shall be deemed to have a ‘qualified year’
if the employee has worked at least 94 days.”
c. The following modification applies to Paragraph 74(f) of the West Coast Studio
Local Agreements (and Paragraph 19 of the Local 871 (Production Office
Coordinator, Assistant Production Office Coordinator, Art Department
Coordinator) Agreement, Paragraph 30 of the Local 871 Script Coordinators and
Writers’ Room Assistants Agreement, Paragraph 3(a)(28)(E) of the Local 700
Majors and Independents Amendment Agreements):
Modify the definition of a ‘qualified year’ so that an employee whose
employment is severed on or after [insert date that is August 4, 2024 or the first
Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of
ratification, whichever is later] or whose retirement date is on or after [insert date
that is August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the
AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later], is required to have 170
work days within a 365 consecutive day period (rather than 200 work days) in
order to have a qualified year. The foregoing shall apply prospectively only (i.e.,
it does not apply to qualified years for which the work days occurred prior to the
effective date of this provision), except that when a 365 consecutive day lookback
period includes days that fall both within the term of the 2021 Agreement and
within the term of the 2024 Agreement, the employee will be awarded a
qualifying year if the employee worked 170 days within that 365 consecutive day
lookback period.

17. Bulletin re: Non-Roster Classifications
Producers agree to issue the following bulletin to the appropriate production personnel:
“During the 2024 negotiations for the IATSE Basic Agreement, the Local Unions asked
that employees they represent who are employed in job classifications for which no
hiring roster exists be given consideration for open positions in those job classifications.
Because the Local Unions may be able to recommend qualified personnel to fill open
positions, we encourage you to reach out to the applicable Local Union as a resource for
qualified personnel.”
18. Paid Sick Leave
a. Expanded Paid Sick Leave
Modify Article XLVI. of the Basic Agreement as follows:
“XLVI. Paid Sick Leave
“(a) Accrual. Eligible employees covered by the IATSE Basic
Agreement shall accrue one (1) hour of paid sick leave for every thirty (30) hours
worked for Producer, up to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours or six (6) days
(up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours or ten (10) days, effective [insert date that
is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the
AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]). (In lieu of the
foregoing hourly accrual of paid sick leave, and provided that advance notice is
given to the employee, a Producer may elect to provide employees, upon their
eligibility to use sick leave as provided below (i.e., upon working thirty (30) days
for the Producer and after their ninetieth (90th) day (forty-fifth day, effective
[insert date that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day
on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]) of such
employment with the Producer (based on days worked or guaranteed), with a
bank of twenty-four (24) hours or three (3) days of sick leave per year (forty (40)
hours or five (5) days of sick leave per year, effective [insert date that is January
1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP
receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]), such year to be measured, as
designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year or starting from the
employee's anniversary date. Under this elected option, such banked sick leave
days may not be carried over to the following year.) Employees employed
outside California shall be eligible for such sick leave commencing February 1,
2022.
“(b) To be eligible to accrue paid sick leave, the employee must have
worked for the Producer for at least thirty (30) days within a one (1) year period,
such year to be measured, as designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year
or starting from the employee's anniversary date. Sick leave may be used in
minimum increments of four (4) hours upon oral or written request after the
00317375.DOCX; 14 46

--- PAGE 49 of 71 ---

eligible employee has been employed by the Producer for ninety (90) days (forty-
five (45) days, effective [insert date that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday
following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification,
whichever is later]) (based on days worked or guaranteed), such period to be
measured, as designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year or starting from
the employee's anniversary date. Reasonable advance notification of the need for
sick leave is required if the use is foreseeable; otherwise, notice is required as
soon as practicable. Sick days accrued on an hourly basis shall carry over to the
following year of employment; however, the Producer may limit the use of such
accrued time to no more than twenty-four (24) hours or three (3) days (no more
than forty (40) hours or five (5) days, effective [insert date that is January 1,
2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives
notice of ratification, whichever is later]) during each year of employment as
defined by the Employer in advance. To the extent the employee is eligible for
paid sick leave in a jurisdiction with a law that cannot be waived in a collective
bargaining agreement, any sick leave paid pursuant to the law shall count towards
satisfying the Producer’s obligations to provide paid sick leave under this Article
XLVI.
“(c) For employees employed on an hourly or daily basis, a day of sick
leave pay shall be equal to eight (8) hours' pay at the employee's straight time
hourly rate. If a four (4) hour increment of sick leave is taken, the employee shall
be paid four (4) hours of pay at the employee’s his straight time hourly rate. For
weekly employees (including "on call" employees), a day of sick leave pay shall
be equal to one-fifth (1/5th) of the employee's weekly rate under the studio
minimum wage scales or one-sixth (1/6th) of the employee's weekly rate under
the distant location minimum wage scales (or fifty percent (50%) thereof for a
four (4) hour increment of sick leave taken). Replacements for weekly employees
(including "on call" employees) may be hired on a pro rata basis of the weekly
rate regardless of any contrary provision in this Agreement. The employee shall
not be required to find a replacement as a condition of exercising the employee’s
his right to paid sick leave.
“(d) Sick leave may be taken for the diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing
health condition of, or preventive care for, the employee or the employee's
"family member."23 Sick leave also may be taken by an employee who is a victim
of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.
23 "Family member" means any of the following: (1) a biological, adopted or foster child,
stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis; (2) a biological,
adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or the employee's spouse
or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a
minor child; (3) a spouse; (4) a registered domestic partner; (5) a grandparent; (6) a grandchild;
or (7) a sibling.
00317375.DOCX; 14 47

--- PAGE 50 of 71 ---

“(e) Accrued, unused sick leave is not paid out on termination,
resignation or other separation from employment. If an employee is rehired by
the Producer within one (1) year of the employee's separation from employment,
the employee's accrued and unused sick leave shall be reinstated, and the
employee may begin using the accrued sick leave upon rehire if the employee was
previously eligible to use the sick leave or once the employee becomes eligible as
provided above.
“(f) Producer shall include in the employee's start paperwork the
contact information for the designated Producer representative whom the
employee may contact to confirm eligibility and the amount of accrued sick leave
available. Such start paperwork shall also include information with respect to the
year period (i.e., calendar year or the employee's anniversary date) that the
Producer selected to measure the thirty (30) day and ninety (90) day (forty-five
(45) day, effective [insert date that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday
following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification,
whichever is later]) eligibility periods and the cap on accrual set forth in
subparagraph (b) above or, alternatively, if the Producer elected to provide
employees with a sick leave bank, the year period (i.e., calendar year or the
employee's anniversary date) that the Producer selected for the bank of three (3)
sick days (five (5) sick days, effective [insert date that is January 1, 2025 or the
first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of
ratification, whichever is later]) as provided in subparagraph (a) above. Producer
also shall notify the West Coast office of the IATSE of the name and contact
information of the designated Producer representative.
“(g) Any Producer that, as of June 30, 2015, had a sick leave policy, or
paid leave or paid time off policy that permits the use of paid sick time with
respect to eligible employees working in California or that, as of February 1,
2022, has a sick leave policy, or paid leave or paid time off policy that permits the
use of paid sick time for all other eligible employees, may continue such policy in
lieu of the foregoing. Nothing shall prevent a Producer from negotiating a sick
leave policy with better terms and conditions. There shall be no discrimination or
retaliation against any employee for the exerciseing of the employee’s his or her
right to use paid sick leave.
“(h) Any dispute with respect to sick leave for employees covered
under the West Coast Studio Local Agreements shall be subject to the grievance
and arbitration procedures provided therein.”
Make conforming changes to the Paid Sick Leave provisions of the West Coast
Studio Local Agreements: Article 12 of the Local 44 Agreement, Local 80 (Grips)
Agreement, Local 80 (First Aid) Agreement, Local 600 (Camera) Agreement,

19. Bereavement Leave
Add the following as a new Paragraph to the West Coast Studio Local Agreements and
Amendment Agreements effective August 4, 2024 or the first Sunday following the
business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later.
“In the event of the death of a ‘family member’* of a regularly scheduled employee, the
employee shall be allowed up to three (3) days of paid bereavement leave. For
employees employed on an hourly or daily basis, a day of bereavement leave pay shall be
equal to eight (8) hours' pay at the employee's straight time hourly rate. For weekly
employees (including ‘on call’ employees), a day of bereavement leave pay shall be equal
to one-fifth (1/5th) of the employee's weekly rate under the studio minimum wage scales
or one-sixth (1/6th) of the employee's weekly rate under the distant location minimum
wage scales.
“An employee who is absent from work due to bereavement leave will be reinstated to
the employee’s original position on the production upon return, provided that the position
continues to exist; however, for continuity purposes, a Producer is not required to
reinstate an employee on an episodic series until work on the current episode has been
completed. The Producer and the Union will discuss on a case-by-case basis, upon the
request of the Producer, issues related to the individual’s reinstatement.
“* ‘Family member’ means any of the following: (1) a biological, adopted or foster child,
stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis; (2) a
biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or the
employee's spouse or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis
when the employee was a minor child; (3) a spouse; (4) a registered domestic partner; (5)
a grandparent; (6) a grandchild; or (7) a sibling.”

identity, gender expression, veteran status, medical condition (including genetic
characteristics), sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability as defined in the
Americans with Disabilities Act, marital status, Union membership or any other basis
prohibited by applicable law.
“Claims alleging a violation of this ‘Non-Discrimination’ provision are not

“(d) Subcontracting
“The parties recognize the existence of past subcontracting practices within the

Agreements shall remain in effect.
“The Producer, as a matter of preservation of work for employees who have
historically and traditionally performed work under the crafts and classifications as set
forth in this Agreement, the Videotape Agreement or the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements, agrees that as to bargaining unit work of a type which has not heretofore
been subcontracted in the multi-employer bargaining unit, the Producer will subcontract
such bargaining unit work to any other person, corporation, joint venture or entity only:
(1) if the Producer first notifies the IATSE in writing of its intention to subcontract, and
(2) the direct labor costs of the person, corporation, joint venture or entity who will

in this Agreement, the Videotape Agreement, the West Coast Studio Local Agreements
or other applicable collective bargaining agreements; or (3) if the Producer lacks the
requisite technology, facilities or equipment to perform the work. In addition, the
Producer agrees, effective November 1, 2024, to notify the IATSE in writing of its
intention to subcontract bargaining unit work of a type that has heretofore been
subcontracted in the multi-employer bargaining unit. Except with respect to such notice,

restrictions with respect to subcontracting under this Article XX(d).”

employee’s classification which are administered by Contract Services

the employee attends such classes outside his or her of employment. Effective
January 1, 2025, the applicable stipend shall increase to $25.00 for each hour the
employee attends such classes outside of employment.”
