AGREEMENT OF AUGUST 1, 2021
BETWEEN PRODUCER AND I.A.T.S.E. & M.P.T.A.A.C.
AND LOCAL 892 THEREOF .
THIS AGREEMENT, executed as of August 1, 2021 between the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving
Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, its
Territories and Canada (hereinafter referred to as the “IATSE”)
and
COSTUME DESIGNERS GUILD, LOCAL 892
(hereinafter referred to as the “Local Union” and/or “the Guild”) of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving
Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, its
Territories and Canada (both hereinafter referred to as the “Union”), on
the one hand, and the following companies, separately and respectively:
THE ALLIANCE OF MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION
PRODUCERS ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANIES LISTED ON
EXHIBIT “A” ATTACHED HERETO, ALL OF WHICH
CONSTITUTE A SINGLE MULTI-EMPLOYER BARGAINING
UNIT (each hereinafter respectively referred to as the “Producer” and
collectively referred to as the “Producers”), on the other hand.
In consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the
parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1. Scope of Agreement
This Agreement is made subject to the “Producer - I.A.T.S.E. and
M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic Agreement of 2021.”
This Agreement shall be applicable to the classifications of
employees listed in the “Wage Scales, Hours of Employment and
Working Conditions” set forth herein, employed by Producer to perform
services in the County of Los Angeles, or hired by the Producer in the
County of Los Angeles to perform services outside the said County, but
within the limits of the United States, its territories and Canada.
In the event the Producer elects to and does employ a person in the
County of Los Angeles, California to perform work outside the limits of
the United States, its territories and Canada in any of the job

--- PAGE 6 of 175 ---

classifications covered hereunder, then the provisions of this Agreement
shall apply to such person. However, such person and Producer may
make any other agreement to apply to such employment, such as a “flat
deal” contract, in the place and stead of the provisions of this
Agreement, provided such other agreement requires not less than
seventy-five (75) hours per week in pension and health contributions to
be made on behalf of such person (which amount may be prorated for
partial workweeks).
The term “employee,” as hereinafter used, shall be deemed to
mean an employee subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.
ARTICLE 2. Recognition
The Producer recognizes the IATSE as the exclusive collective
bargaining representative of all employees employed by Producer in the
classifications listed in this Agreement. The Union makes this
Agreement on behalf of such employees, the majority of whom the
Union warrants are members of the Union in good standing.
The Local Union represents that the terms of this Agreement have
been submitted to its membership and have been duly approved thereby.
ARTICLE 3. Union Security
(a) Each employee of the Producer subject to the provisions of
this Agreement shall, as a condition of employment, be or become a
member of the Guild on and after the thirtieth day following the first day
of his employment, or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever
is the later.
As defined and applied in this Article 3(a), the term “member of
the Union in good standing” means a person who offers to pay (and, if
the Union accepts the offer, pays) Union initiation fees and dues as
financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the National
Labor Relations Act.
(b) The Producer may employ or continue to employ any such
then-employed employee who does not become or is not a member of
the Guild as required under subparagraph (a) above, until: (1) the Guild
first gives the Producer a written notice that such employee has not
become or is not then a member of the Guild, as above required, because
of such employee’s failure to tender the periodic dues and initiation fees
- 2 -

--- PAGE 7 of 175 ---

uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining such
membership, as the case may be, and (2) such employee fails to tender to
the Guild such required periodic dues or initiation fees, as the case may
be, within three (3) business days after Producer receives such notice; in
which event Producer, upon receipt of written notice by the Guild
requesting the discharge of such employee for non-membership, as
herein provided, shall discharge said employee at the close of the shift
on which such employee is working at the time Producer receives this
notice.
(c) Producer agrees to inform the Guild, in writing, within seven
(7) days (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) from the date of
first employment hereafter, of the name, residence address, social
security number and date of employment of any employee subject to this
Agreement; provided, that an inadvertent failure to give such notice shall
not be considered a breach of this Agreement.
(d) Producer shall notify the Guild of the employment of any
person who renders services covered by this Agreement whether or not
such employment is first employment covered by subparagraph (c)
above or such employment is covered by a personal service contract
covered by Paragraph 58.
All notices required by this Agreement are to be sent by Producer
to the Guild and copies of personal service contracts shall be sent to the
Guild’s representative.
ARTICLE 4. Wage Scales, Hours of Employment and Working
Conditions
Wage scales, hours of employment and working conditions shall
be as set forth in the “Wage Scales, Hours of Employment and Working
Conditions” herein for employees employed on theatrical and television

one-hour and long-form prime time1 dramatic television motion pictures
recorded digitally.

8:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones from Monday through Saturday
(one hour earlier in the Central and Mountain time zones) and between the hours of 7:00 p.m.

employees employed on one-half hour prime time dramatic television
motion pictures recorded digitally,2 except that:
(a) Paragraphs 5 (“Night Premiums”) and 10 (“Rest Periods”) of

Videotape Agreement shall apply to employees employed on one- half
hour dramatic pilots or series recorded digitally that are made for basic

negotiating and obtaining from the Producer better conditions and terms
of employment than those herein provided. Provided also, that the
Producer, at its discretion, with or without Guild consultation, may give
any individual better conditions and terms than those herein provided.
No such granting to any individual of better conditions and terms,
if any, shall in any manner affect the conditions and terms herein
provided, nor shall it be considered in any manner as precedent for
granting better conditions and terms than those herein provided to any
other individuals or job.
2 For sake of clarity, “situation comedies” recorded digitally for television are included
within the meaning of “dramatic television motion pictures.”

ARTICLE 6. Authority of Union and Producer
The Union and the Producer each agrees that it will not maintain
nor adopt any Articles or By-laws or any rules or orders which will be in
conflict with this Agreement.
ARTICLE 7. Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
In the event of any dispute between the Local Union or any of the
persons subject to this Agreement and the Producer with regard to wage
scales, hours of employment or working conditions or with regard to the
interpretation of this Agreement concerning such provisions, the
procedure, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be as
follows:
Step One - The aggrieved party shall mail or deliver to the other
party a written notice of the claim and concurrently furnish a copy of
such notice to the International Representative of the IATSE and
Contract Services Administration Trust Fund. Such written notice shall
contain the specific contract sections which are alleged to have been
violated, the date(s) or approximate date(s) of the alleged violation(s),
the facts on which the grievance is based, the name of the production (if
any), the remedy sought and the names of the individuals aggrieved,
when known, except for group claims for which the classifications of the
individuals aggrieved, when known, shall be listed.
A claim by the Local Union that the confirmation set forth in the
second paragraph of Paragraph 6(a) of this Agreement has been violated
by a Producer may be filed only upon the written approval of the West
Coast office of the International Union. Such written approval shall
accompany the claim.
The party which has received the grievance shall, within fifteen
(15) working days after the grievance has been received, respond in
writing to the aggrieved party, setting forth the reasons, if any, for the
action(s) taken by it, which action(s) gave rise to the grievance. Copies
of such written response shall also be furnished to the same parties
served with the grievance. The representative of the Local Union and
the designated representative of Producer shall immediately discuss the
matter and the grievance shall be settled if at all possible. The decision,
if any, of such representatives shall be final and binding upon the parties
and any employees concerned.
If the party receiving the grievance fails to serve the written
response as required by Step One, then the other party may elect to
- 5 -

--- PAGE 10 of 175 ---

proceed directly to arbitration or to Step Two by serving a written
demand upon the other party within five (5) working days after the
written response was due.
Conciliation Committee
Step Two - If, within ten (10) working days after the response has
been served, the parties fail to meet, or if the grievance is not settled,
then the aggrieved party may proceed to Step Two, by delivering or
mailing, within five (5) working days thereafter, a written demand,
which shall include a statement of the particulars of the claim, upon the
other party and upon the International Representative of the IATSE and
CSATF. If neither party requests a Step Two conciliation meeting, then
the aggrieved party may proceed directly to Step Three regarding
expedited or regular arbitration, by serving a written demand upon the
other party within the time periods set forth above. Failure of the
aggrieved party to so serve such demand for a Step Two conciliation
meeting or an arbitration shall constitute a waiver of the claim, unless
the parties mutually stipulate otherwise in Step One.
If a demand for Step Two is so served, the grievance shall be
brought before the Conciliation Committee as soon as practicable, but
not later than twenty (20) working days following the receipt of such
notice. The Conciliation Committee shall consist of an International
Representative of the IATSE and a representative of CSATF.
The parties to the grievance shall be present and shall be
responsible for the presentation of their own position at such time and
place. If the aggrieved party fails to appear, then the grievance shall be
considered as waived. If the responding party fails to appear, then the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to proceed with the presentation of its
position, and the Conciliation Committee, upon presentation of evidence
showing a contract violation, shall have the authority to and shall issue
an immediate final and binding award in favor of the aggrieved party,
including an appropriate remedy.
If either party intends to appear, but does not intend to present any
facts or arguments as to a defense or as to the claim, then such party
shall so notify the other party as to such intention at least three (3) days
prior to the conciliation meeting. In any event, either party may, at least
three (3) days prior to the date of the Conciliation Committee meeting,
cancel such Conciliation Committee meeting and the aggrieved party
may proceed directly to arbitration under Step Three.
The AMPTP and the IATSE shall adopt written rules and
procedures which shall be designed to foster to the maximum extent
- 6 -

--- PAGE 11 of 175 ---

possible the exploratory and conciliatory nature of Step Two of this
procedure.
The Conciliation Committee shall, at the beginning of the meeting,
assist the parties in a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute. In the
event the parties, identified as the Producer and the Union, are able to
resolve the grievance with the assistance of the Conciliation Committee,
the Conciliation Committee shall reduce the resolution of the grievance
to writing as a binding determination on all parties. Such a
determination shall be signed by the parties.
If the dispute is not resolved as provided above, then both parties
at that time must declare whether they will be bound by a decision of the
Conciliation Committee. If both parties agree to be bound, then the
Conciliation Committee shall hear the evidence and arguments of the
parties and shall render a decision, which may include a “no decision”
award, which shall be final and binding on all the parties, including any
individual grievant. Disputes involving jurisdiction or technological
changes shall be specifically excluded from the jurisdiction of the
Conciliation Committee.
The Conciliation Committee shall have the right, upon written
request of either party, to refer the dispute back to the parties, without
prejudice to the merits and without expanding the time limits for the
filing of a grievance or a response, if the Conciliation Committee is of
the opinion that either the written grievance or response does not meet
the requirements set forth in Step One.
Step Three - If the parties do not agree that the Conciliation
Committee’s recommendation will be final and binding on them or if the
parties fail to resolve the grievance, or if the Conciliation Committee has
issued a “no decision” award, then the parties may proceed to expedited
arbitration or regular arbitration as provided below:
(a) Expedited Arbitration - The aggrieved party may elect to
proceed to expedited arbitration within ten (10) working days following
the Step Two meeting if no agreement has been reached by the parties,
or within ten (10) working days following the cancellation of the Step
Two meeting, but only in cases wherein the claim arises under
Paragraph 68 involving disputes relating to the failure to follow studio
seniority or industry seniority, and disputes arising under Paragraph 68
covering the discharge or discipline for cause of an employee subject to
Paragraph 68 of the applicable West Coast Studio Local Agreements, or
in cases wherein the claim for wage payments, adjustments and/or
damages consistent with the contract does not exceed fifteen thousand
dollars ($15,000). The aggrieved party may likewise proceed to
- 7 -

--- PAGE 12 of 175 ---

expedited arbitration following Step Two over disputes with regard to
only “WAGE SCALES, HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT, AND
WORKING CONDITIONS” provision of the Agreement subject to this
Article and provided the claim for damages does not exceed fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000). Any other case may be submitted to
expedited arbitration only by the mutual agreement of the parties.
Disputes involving jurisdiction or technological changes shall
be specifically excluded from the jurisdiction of expedited arbitration.
Except as time limits are set forth in Paragraph 68, cases that
are submitted to expedited arbitration shall be heard within ten (10)
working days after the other party received the demand for expedited
arbitration or within ten (10) working days after the other party gives
notice of its agreement to proceed to expedited arbitration in cases in
which the mutual agreement of the parties is required.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers and
the IATSE shall revise the list of arbitrators assigned to hear expedited
arbitrations. The list shall consist of four (4) arbitrators and one (1)
alternate with recognized experience as professional labor arbitrators.
During the term of this Agreement, the parties may mutually
add the names of additional persons to the panel of neutral arbitrators to
either supplement the panel or replace persons no longer available to
serve.
From the panel of names of the neutral arbitrators set forth
above, the arbitrators shall be assigned, depending upon their
availability, in rotation, to the cases as they arise. The parties may, by
mutual consent, select an arbitrator out of rotation provided that notice
of their selection is given to CSATF prior to the appointment of the
arbitrator next in rotation.
The expedited arbitration hearing shall be presided over by a
neutral arbitrator assigned from the panel of neutral arbitrators. The
IATSE and CSATF shall schedule the grievances to be heard in order of
receipt. The grievances must be heard by the assigned arbitrator unless
that individual becomes unavailable, in which instance the next
arbitrator in the rotation shall hear the grievance. If either party intends
to be represented by outside counsel at the expedited arbitration hearing,
then such party must notify the opposing party within two (2) working
days after the hearing date for the expedited arbitration has been
determined. The parties, who may be represented by outside counsel,
will not file post-hearing briefs, but may, prior to or during the hearing,
present a written statement of the facts. If either party so desires, a
- 8 -

--- PAGE 13 of 175 ---

stenographic record may be made and that party shall pay for the
transcript. In such cases, the transcript shall be solely for the use of the
party requesting it and shall not be used to delay a decision in the matter.
The two preceding sentences shall not apply to roster placement nor
roster removal arbitrations, for which no stenographic record shall be
made. The neutral arbitrator shall have sole authority to rule on all
motions and decide the case.
The writing of an opinion will be at the discretion of the
neutral arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator, which shall be issued
orally and confirmed in writing if requested by either party at the
conclusion of the hearing, or in writing within three (3) days from the
conclusion of the hearing (the choice being at the sole discretion of the
arbitrator) shall be final and binding upon the parties and any employees
concerned. The neutral arbitrator shall have the power to determine only
the specific grievance or dispute and, when appropriate, award wage
adjustments or damages consistent with the contract, in an amount not to
exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), but shall not have the power
to amend, modify or effect a change in any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor to determine jurisdictional or technological change
disputes. The decision of the neutral arbitrator shall be non-precedential
and his decision and/or opinion, if any, shall not be offered or admitted
into evidence in any other proceeding other than: (1) a judicial action
seeking confirmation, correction or vacation of said decision; or (2) a
grievance or arbitration proceeding involving the same Producer and
Local Union.
Fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by
the parties to the dispute. All other costs shall be borne by the party
incurring the same.
The bills of the arbitrator, together with a completed
information form, shall be sent by the arbitrator to the IATSE and the
Producer involved in the expedited arbitration with copies to CSATF.
The information form shall be jointly prepared by the IATSE and
CSATF. The neutral arbitrator shall proceed to hear a dispute properly
before him under this provision of expedited arbitration, notwithstanding
the fact that a similar case may be pending in a regular arbitration.
(b) Regular Arbitration - The aggrieved party may elect to
proceed to regular arbitration within ten (10) working days following the
Step Two meeting if no agreement has been reached by the parties or
within ten (10) working days following the cancellation of the Step Two
meeting.
- 9 -

--- PAGE 14 of 175 ---

The IATSE and the Producers agree to establish a panel of
individuals with recognized experience as professional labor arbitrators
as members of a standing panel of neutral arbitrators. The panel shall
comprise an odd number of arbitrators.
If demand is served for regular arbitration, then the parties
shall select a sole arbitrator to hear and determine the grievance by
mutual agreement. If the parties cannot agree to the arbitrator to be
appointed, then each party shall have the right to alternately strike an
arbitrator’s name from the panel until such time as one (1) arbitrator is
left and the remaining arbitrator shall be selected and appointed as the
arbitrator in the proceedings.
The parties shall select the arbitrator within five (5) working
days after the demand for regular arbitration has been served. The
parties may, by mutual agreement, select the arbitrator outside of the
panel of neutral arbitrators or utilize the list of arbitrators obtained from
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
Such hearing shall be held within fourteen (14) days after the
arbitrator is selected, at such time and place as the arbitrator shall
determine. If the arbitrator so selected is unable or unwilling to
undertake the arbitration within the time limit herein provided, another
arbitrator shall be selected from such list. The decision of the arbitrator
shall be rendered in writing, stating his reasons for the award, within
thirty (30) days after the submission of the grievance for decision. The
arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto
and upon any employees concerned. The arbitrator shall have the power
to determine the specific grievance or dispute, but shall not have the
power to amend, modify or effect a change in any of the provisions of
the Agreement, nor to determine jurisdictional disputes.
Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and cost of a court
reporter and original transcript, when jointly requested, shall be borne
equally by the parties to the dispute; otherwise, the party making such
request shall pay for it. All other costs shall be borne by the party
incurring same.
(c) Claims - Any claims for the payment of wages or severance
pay, not presented under Step One within three hundred sixty-five (365)
consecutive days after the employee is entitled to such wages or
severance pay, shall be deemed to be waived. Any dispute as to the
correct amount of payment of holiday or vacation pay, not presented
under Step One within three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days
after March 15 of the calendar year next following the calendar year in
- 10 -

--- PAGE 15 of 175 ---

which such holiday or vacation pay, as the case may be, was earned,
shall be deemed to be waived.
Any other claim or grievance not presented under Step One,
within (i) sixty (60) calendar days after the occurrence of the subject
matter of the grievance or (ii) within sixty (60) calendar days after the
employee or the Union has had a reasonable opportunity to become
aware of the occurrence, whichever of (i) or (ii) is the later (but in any
event not to exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after
the occurrence), shall be deemed to be waived. Time on distant location
shall not be included in this period.
For the purpose of this Article, “aggrieved party” shall mean
the Producer or the Union acting on its own behalf or on the behalf of an
employee covered by this Agreement.
(d) In General - The time periods provided for herein may be
extended by mutual written consent of the parties.
(e) Scheduling - In scheduling any grievance in Step Two or
Step Three, preference shall be given to any grievance involving the
discharge of an employee or a grievance involving the Industry
Experience Roster.
(f) Disciplinary Memos - Disciplinary memos issued to an
employee are admissible evidence in a grievance and/or arbitration
proceeding. However, such disciplinary memoranda, other than those
resulting in a suspension or discharge, issued more than two (2) years
prior to the incident or events giving rise to said grievance shall not be
admissible.
(g) An arbitration award issued in either expedited or regular
arbitration proceedings or a final and binding award rendered in Step
Two of the grievance procedure which requires the payment of a specific
sum of money shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of the
award. If payment is not made within said period, interest shall accrue
on the sum(s) due from the date of the award at the rate of one percent
(1%) per month.
If a calculation is required to determine the specific
amount(s) due under the award, the Producer shall calculate such
amount(s) and shall notify the other party of the specific sum(s) due
within sixty (60) days of the date of the award. If such calculation is not
made or if notice is not given as required, interest shall accrue on the
sum(s) due from the date of the award at a rate of one percent (1%) per
month. If, after calculation, the parties disagree on the sum(s) due, or if
- 11 -

--- PAGE 16 of 175 ---

the amount(s) due and owing under the award cannot be calculated
within the sixty-day period as a result of factors beyond the control of
the Producer, then no interest shall accrue upon the sum(s) due.
ARTICLE 8. Conflict With Laws
In the event that any provisions of this Agreement relating to the
amounts and payment of wages or other financial benefits are affected
by any legislation, decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or
governmental regulation in such manner so that such wages or other
financial benefits would be increased over, or decreased under, the
amount intended to be paid by the parties hereto at the time of the
execution of this Agreement, then each of the parties hereto agrees that
upon written notice from the other party setting forth the provisions to
be negotiated, they will renegotiate for modification of such provisions
so that such provisions will conform to such legislation, decision of a
court of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation, as the case
may be, and will provide, as nearly as possible, for payment of wages or
other financial benefits in the amount intended to be paid by the parties
hereto at the time of the execution hereof.
If the parties are unable to arrive at an agreement within thirty (30)
days after delivery of such notice, then such provisions in question shall
be immediately submitted to an Arbitration Committee composed of one
member designated by the Producer, one member by the Union and an
Impartial Chairman, to be selected by such other two (2) members
within ten (10) days following such thirty-day period provided above.
This Arbitration Committee shall promptly proceed to hear and settle
such matter. The authority of this Arbitration Committee to decide shall
be limited solely to determining the appropriate modifications of such
provisions so that such provisions will conform to such legislation,
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation,
as the case may be, and will provide, as nearly as possible, for the
payment of wages and other financial benefits in the amount intended to
be paid by the parties at the time of execution of this Agreement.
The terms and conditions of such appropriate modifications, if any,
by the said Arbitration Committee, shall be effective and operative as of
the date on which the provisions, so modified accordingly, were so
affected by any such legislation, decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction or governmental regulation, as the case may be, in such
manner and to the extent as above described and provided. The amounts
and payments of wages or other financial benefits contained in such
appropriate modifications, if any, made by such Arbitration Committee,
shall be computed and paid thereunder retroactive to the effective date of
- 12 -

--- PAGE 17 of 175 ---

such modifications. In the event that no such modifications can be
made, as above provided, because of any legislation, decision of a court
of competent jurisdiction or governmental regulation, Producer shall not
be liable for any retroactive back pay adjustments, or any other penalty,
if any such modification is thereafter permissible. The decision of the
said Arbitration Committee shall be final and shall not be subject to the
Grievance and Arbitration Procedure in Article 7 above, but its authority
to decide shall be limited to the issue and remedy herein provided. The
above procedure and conditions shall be the exclusive remedy for
determining any dispute arising under this Article 8.
Upon written notice by such Arbitration Committee to the
respective parties hereto, the modification of such provisions as
determined by said Committee, as above provided, shall automatically
become a part of this Agreement. Fees and expenses of the Impartial
Chairman shall be borne equally by the Union and the Producer.

Agreement. Such notice shall set forth in detail the proposals or
recommendations of the party serving said notice of request for
renegotiation. If such notice is served, the parties agree to commence
negotiations within thirty (30) days after May 1, 2024 concerning the
proposals or recommendations set forth in such notice and to continue
negotiations diligently and in good faith on such proposals or
recommendations which are submitted in such negotiations.

ARTICLE 11. Gender - Included Meanings
Words used in this Agreement in the masculine gender include the
feminine and the neuter.
ARTICLE 12. “Professional” Capacity
The Guild and the Producer have agreed that the employees
hereunder are employed by the Producer in a “professional” capacity
within the meaning of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as
amended.
ARTICLE 13. Paid Sick Leave
(a) Accrual. Eligible employees covered by the IATSE Basic
Agreement shall accrue one (1) hour of paid sick leave for every thirty
(30) hours worked for Producer, up to a maximum of forty-eight (48)
hours or six (6) days. (In lieu of the foregoing hourly accrual of paid
sick leave, and provided that advance notice is given to the employee, a
Producer may elect to provide employees, upon their eligibility to use
sick leave as provided below (i.e., upon working thirty (30) days for the
Producer and after their ninetieth (90th) day of such employment with
the Producer (based on days worked or guaranteed), with a bank of
twenty- four (24) hours or three (3) days of sick leave per year, such
year to be measured, as designated by the Producer, as either a calendar
year or starting from the employee’s anniversary date. Under this
elected option, such banked sick leave days may not be carried over to
the following year.) Employees employed outside California shall be
eligible for such sick leave commencing February 1, 2022.
(b) To be eligible to accrue paid sick leave, the employee must
have worked for the Producer for at least thirty (30) days within a one
(1) year period, such year to be measured, as designated by the Producer,
as either a calendar year or starting from the employee’s anniversary
date. Sick leave may be used in minimum increments of four (4) hours
upon oral or written request after the eligible employee has been
employed by the Producer for ninety (90) days (based on days worked or
guaranteed), such period to be measured, as designated by the Producer,
as either a calendar year or starting from the employee’s anniversary
date. Reasonable advance notification of the need for sick leave is
required if the use is foreseeable; otherwise, notice is required as soon as
practicable. Sick days accrued on an hourly basis shall carry over to the
following year of employment; however, the Producer may limit the use
of such accrued time to no more than twenty-four (24) hours or three (3)
- 14 -

--- PAGE 19 of 175 ---

days during each year of employment as defined by the Employer in
advance. To the extent the employee is eligible for paid sick leave in a
jurisdiction with a law that cannot be waived in a collective bargaining
agreement, any sick leave paid pursuant to the law shall count towards
satisfying the Producer's obligations to provide paid sick leave under this
Article.
(c) For employees employed on an hourly or daily basis, a day of
sick leave pay shall be equal to eight (8) hours’ pay at the employee’s
straight time hourly rate. If a four (4) hour increment of sick leave is
taken, the employee shall be paid four (4) hours of pay at his straight
time hourly rate. For weekly employees (including “on call”
employees), a day of sick leave pay shall be equal to one-fifth (1/5th) of
the employee’s weekly rate under the studio minimum wage scales or
one-sixth (1/6th) of the employee’s weekly rate under the distant
location minimum wage scales (or fifty percent (50%) thereof for a four
(4) hour increment of sick leave taken). Replacements for weekly
employees (including “on call” employees) may be hired on a pro rata
basis of the weekly rate regardless of any contrary provision in this
Agreement. The employee shall not be required to find a replacement as
a condition of exercising his right to paid sick leave.
(d) Sick leave may be taken for the diagnosis, care or treatment
of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, the employee
or the employee’s “family member.”3 Sick leave also may be taken by
an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or
stalking.
(e) Accrued, unused sick leave is not paid out on termination,
resignation or other separation from employment. If an employee is
rehired by the Producer within one (1) year of the employee’s separation
from employment, the employee’s accrued and unused sick leave shall
be reinstated, and the employee may begin using the accrued sick leave
upon rehire if the employee was previously eligible to use the sick leave
or once the employee becomes eligible as provided above.
(f) Producer shall include in the employee’s start paperwork the
contact information for the designated Producer representative whom the
employee may contact to confirm eligibility and the amount of accrued
3 “Family member” means any of the following: (1) a biological, adopted or foster child,
stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis; (2) a biological,
adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or the employee’s spouse
or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a
minor child; (3) a spouse; (4) a registered domestic partner; (5) a grandparent; (6) a grandchild;
or (7) a sibling.

--- PAGE 20 of 175 ---

sick leave available. Such start paperwork shall also include information
with respect to the year period (i.e., calendar year or the employee’s
anniversary date) that the Producer selected to measure the thirty (30)
day and ninety (90) day eligibility periods and the cap on accrual set
forth in subparagraph (b) above or, alternatively, if the Producer elected
to provide employees with a sick leave bank, the year period (i.e.,
calendar year or the employee’s anniversary date) that the Producer
selected for the bank of three (3) sick days as provided in subparagraph
(a) above. Producer also shall notify the West Coast office of the
IATSE of the name and contact information of the designated Producer
representative.
(g) Any Producer that, as of June 30, 2015, had a sick leave
policy, or paid leave or paid time off policy that permits the use of paid
sick time with respect to eligible employees working in California or
that, as of February 1, 2022, has a sick leave policy, or paid leave or paid
time off policy that permits the use of paid sick time for all other eligible
employees, may continue such policy in lieu of the foregoing. Nothing
shall prevent a Producer from negotiating a sick leave policy with better
terms and conditions. There shall be no discrimination or retaliation
against any employee for exercising his or her right to use paid sick
leave.
(h) Any dispute with respect to sick leave for employees covered
under this Agreement shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration
procedures provided herein.

Time Act and Similar Laws
The Union expressly waives, to the full extent permitted by law,

1 “On Call” Employee Work on Recognized Holidays - If an
employee hired under the “On Call” Schedule is specifically
instructed and required by Producer to perform work on a
recognized holiday, under the direction and control of Producer, he
shall be paid an additional one-fifth (1/5) of the “on call” weekly
rate in effect for each day so worked.
“On Call” Employee Work on Six (6) or Seven (7) Days Within
the Employee’s Workweek - If an employee hired under the “On
Call” Schedule is specifically instructed and required by Producer
to perform work on six (6) or seven (7) days within the employee’s
workweek, under the direction and control of the Producer, he shall
receive one and one-half times one-fifth (1/5) of the “on call”
weekly rate in effect for the sixth or seventh day(s) so worked.
Such provisions shall apply to employees hired under the “On
Call” Schedule who, having commenced work on the previous day,
continue to work past 1:00 a.m. on such sixth or seventh day
within the employee’s workweek or recognized holiday, as the
case may be, and who worked at least fifteen (15) hours, including
meal period, before being dismissed on such sixth or seventh day
within the employee’s workweek or recognized holiday, as the
case may be. In any event, an employee hired under the “On Call”
Schedule who does not so work past 1:00 a.m. on such sixth or
seventh day within the employee’s workweek or recognized
holiday shall not be deemed to have worked on such day by reason
of work between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 a.m. of that day.
The term “rate in effect” means wage scale plus amounts in excess
of scale, if any.
2 On television productions, if a Costume Designer is hired under
this Agreement on a daily basis, the Producer must engage a
person not on the payroll of that production. For each day so
worked, Producer shall submit contributions to the Pension and
Health Plans on behalf of the Costume Designer based on twelve
(12) hours.
In hiring daily schedule Costume Designers, Producer shall give
preference of employment to qualified Costume Designers as
provided in Paragraph 68 of the Local 892 Agreement.
3 Assistant Costume Designers are employees designated by
Producer to work under the supervision and direction of Costume
Designers. The duties are the same as those of a Costume
Designer.

below.
5. Night Premiums
Work time for “Off Production” employees shall be paid for
according to the following schedule:
(a) Employees called to work between 6:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m.
shall receive a ten percent (10%) premium for all time worked between
8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
(b) Employees called to work between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
shall receive a twenty percent (20%) premium for all time worked.
(c) Employees called to work between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
shall receive a twenty percent (20%) premium for all time worked until
6:00 a.m. and straight time for the remainder of the minimum call.
6. Minimum Calls
(a) The minimum call is a guarantee of employment for the
number of hours of the minimum call indicated in the wage schedules.
The parties hereby confirm the following: The guaranteed
length of employment shall be daily or weekly. A guarantee for a longer
term shall be specifically set forth in writing. An employee may be
replaced following completion of the guaranteed period of employment.
(b) Employees shall hold themselves in readiness to serve the
Producer during the period of the minimum call and such additional time
as the Producer may require.
(c) No Clause.
(d) Minimum calls for Weekly Schedule employees are
guaranteed for five (5) consecutive days out of seven (7) consecutive
- 23 -

--- PAGE 28 of 175 ---

days, commencing with the first of such five (5) days worked, including
holidays, during the period of employment.
(e) (1) Prior to November 21, 2021, a four (4) hour minimum
call shall apply for any day on which an employee, at the request of an
individual Producer, reports for safety training. A daily “on call”
employee who reports for safety training shall be paid one-half (½) of
the daily “on call” rate for each such day; a weekly “on call” employee
shall be paid one-tenth (1/10) of the weekly “on call” rate for each such
day.
(2) Effective November 21, 2021, a four (4) hour minimum
call shall apply for any day on which an employee does not work and
reports for training at the request of an individual Producer. A weekly
“on call” employee shall be paid one-tenth (1/10) of the weekly “on
call” rate for each such day. The foregoing does not apply to a day that
is within the weekly guarantee of a weekly employee or a weekly "on
call" employee.
7. Overtime
(a) All time and one-half, “not less than one and one-half,”
double time, Golden Hour pay and pay for the sixth or seventh day
worked in the employee’s workweek and holidays in excess of the
Regular Basic Hourly Rate are paid as overtime compensation and shall
not be compounded.
(b) Overtime paid on a daily basis shall be computed at the
Regular Basic Hourly Rate in effect when the overtime occurs.
(c) Overtime paid on a weekly basis shall be computed at the
mean Regular Basic Hourly Rate.
(d) Night premiums shall be included as a part of the Regular
Basic Hourly Rate in computing overtime.
(e) Meal delay penalties (Paragraph 20) and pay for call-back
intervening time of less than five (5) hours (Paragraph 10) shall be
included as a part of the Regular Basic Hourly Rate in computing
overtime required by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
8. Workweek; Sixth or Seventh Day Worked in an Employee’s
Workweek
(a) The regular studio workweek shall consist of any five (5)
consecutive days out of any seven (7) consecutive days, commencing
- 24 -

--- PAGE 29 of 175 ---

with the first of such five (5) days. However, the five (5) consecutive
day requirement shall not apply upon the commencement of any
regularly-scheduled five-day-per-week shift. (For example, on starting a
new shift, a schedule that provides for an employee to work on Monday
and Tuesday, with Wednesday and Thursday as the regular days off, and
is followed by work on Friday through the following Tuesday does not
violate the five (5) consecutive days requirement.)
(b) Time and one-half shall be paid for the employee’s sixth day
of work within a workweek. Double time shall be paid for the
employee’s seventh day of work within a workweek. If an employee
works six (6) or seven (7) days within his workweek, the sixth or
seventh day worked shall be subject to Paragraph 5, “Night Premiums.”
All employees are paid at their scheduled Regular Basic Hourly Rates as
specified in Paragraph 1.
In the event that any daily employee who is not on a
regularly-scheduled workweek works six (6) days, starting with the first
day worked, within a seven (7) consecutive day period, he shall be paid
time and one-half for the sixth day worked.
If a weekly employee or a regularly-scheduled, five-day-per-
week daily employee is required to work six (6) days in his workweek,
the Producer shall make reasonable good faith efforts to schedule the
employee to work on six (6) consecutive days. Any unresolved dispute
as to whether the Producer has made such reasonable good faith efforts
shall be submitted to the International President and the President of the
AMPTP for resolution.
(c) Except as provided in this subparagraph, a work day starting
on one calendar day and running into the next calendar day shall be
credited to the first calendar day. The foregoing rule shall not apply in
the following situations: (1) If an “on production” employee’s fifth day
of work in a workweek occurs on a Friday and his shift commences after
8:00 p.m. and overlaps into Saturday, he shall be paid time and one-half
for the hours worked on Saturday; and (2) an employee whose work
shift overlaps into a holiday or from a holiday into the next day shall be
paid in accordance with the “Provisions for Holidays Worked” under
this Agreement for those hours worked on the calendar holiday.
(d) The guaranteed pay of weekly employees who absent
themselves without the Producer’s consent may be reduced one-fifth
(1/5) of the weekly guarantee for each day of absence.
(e) (1) In situations involving a change of schedule for
regularly-scheduled employees, accommodations will be made, to the
- 25 -

--- PAGE 30 of 175 ---

extent practicable, to avoid a reduction in the number of workdays for
the employee, without requiring the employer to pay premium pay.
(2) The Producer shall give reasonable notice of a change
of shift (e.g., from a Monday through Friday shift to a Tuesday through
Saturday shift) to regularly-scheduled employees. In the event that the
employee would receive fewer than two (2) days off in the workweek as
a result of the shift change, the following alternatives shall be available:
(i) As to “off production” employees:
(A) If the Producer and the employee so agree,
the employee may work at straight time without having two (2) days off;
(B) The Producer may require employees to take
an additional day off (and such scheduling shall not be deemed to
constitute a prohibited relay call), thereby avoiding premium pay; or
(C) The Producer must pay the employee time
and one-half if it requires the employee to work on the day which would
otherwise be the employee’s regularly-scheduled day off.
(ii) As to “on production” employees, once during the
production of a motion picture, or in the case of episodic television, once
between hiatus periods (i.e., between the commencement or resumption
of production and a cessation of principal photography for the series for
at least one week), the Producer may shift the workweek for employees
working on production without incurring extra costs, by adding one (1)
or two (2) days off consecutive with the sixth and/or seventh days off in
the prior workweek and/or by shifting a workweek commencing on a
Tuesday to a workweek commencing on a Monday, provided that the
intervening Sunday is a day off. Otherwise the Producer must pay the
employee appropriate premium pay if it requires the employee to work
on the day(s) which would otherwise be the employee’s regularly-
scheduled day(s) off.
(iii) In addition to the shift in the workweek outlined
in subparagraph (ii) above, the IATSE agrees that it will not
unreasonably deny a request to shift the workweek of production
employees without incurring additional costs when a production travels
to a new city.
(3) The Producer shall endeavor to make reasonable
accommodations for regularly-scheduled employees on payroll who do
not wish to change to a new shift that includes Saturday or Sunday as
regularly-scheduled workday(s).

(f) The Producer shall not lay off and rehire the same employee
within the same workweek for the purpose of avoiding premium pay.
(g) With respect to assignments to regularly-scheduled, five-day-
per-week shifts that include Saturday and/or Sunday, the Producer will
first solicit volunteers to work such shifts. In the event of an insufficient
number of volunteers to fill such positions, the Producer may hire as
provided in this Agreement.
(h) Employees who are not on the payroll of the Producer will
not be taken off the roster for refusal to accept calls for work on
Saturday and/or Sunday. In other cases, the exceptions to roster removal
set forth in Paragraph 68 of this Agreement shall continue to apply.
(i) In the event an employee is absent on a regularly-scheduled
workday and offers to work an additional day in such workweek to
compensate for the day of absence, and the Producer accepts such offer,
such employee shall be paid at straight time for such “make-up” day.
(j) In the event a holiday falls on an employee’s regularly-
scheduled workday and the employee is not required to work on such
holiday, but is required to work on either or both of his regularly-
scheduled days off in that workweek, such employee shall be paid time
and one-half if he works on one of such regularly-scheduled days off
and, in addition, shall be paid double time if he also works on the second
of such regularly-scheduled days off.
9. Holidays
(a) Work time on holidays shall be subject to Paragraph 5,
“Night Premiums.” All employees are paid at their scheduled Regular

above.

February), Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving and Christmas Day shall

If any of the above holidays falls on a Saturday, the
preceding Friday shall be considered the holiday and if a holiday falls on
Sunday, the following Monday shall be considered the holiday, except
that on distant location, Saturday holidays will be recognized on
Saturday.

For work performed in Canada, Producers may elect to
observe the following Canadian holidays in lieu of the referenced
holidays listed above:
(1) Victoria Day in lieu of Memorial Day; and
(2) Canada Day in lieu of Independence Day (July 4th);
provided that the two holidays are within the employee’s period of
employment and the Producer gives no less than two (2) weeks’ notice
to the affected employee, unless the employee has been employed fewer
than two (2) weeks prior to the first of the two holidays, in which case
the Producer will provide notice to the affected employee at the time of
hire. When the employee has not been employed on the Canadian
holiday set forth above, but is employed to work on the U.S. holiday, the
employee shall be paid a premium for the corresponding U.S. holiday.
The Union will not unreasonably deny requests to exchange other
Canadian holidays for those listed above (such as Family Day in lieu of
Presidents’ Day or Easter Monday in lieu of Good Friday).

(e) The total amount of salary paid in the period January 1, 2021
to and including December 31, 2021, to a Weekly Schedule employee
hereunder for recognized holidays not worked shall be offset against an
amount equal to 3.719% of such employee’s accumulated weekly
schedule earnings within the same period. The employee shall be paid
the amount by which such 3.719% computation exceeds the amount of
holiday pay such employee has received for such period for holidays not
worked.
The total amount of salary paid in the period January 1, 2022
to and including December 31, 2022 and in the period January 1, 2023 to

studio workweeks, and one-sixth (1/6) of such weekly schedule rate of
pay for distant location workweeks.
(2) “Weekly schedule of pay,” in the case of an employee
hired under the “On Call” schedule, shall be deemed to mean the pay
rate specified in the wage scale, plus overscale payment, if any. A day’s
holiday pay for such schedule shall be considered as one-fifth (1/5) of
such weekly schedule rate of pay, plus overscale payment, if any, for
studio workweeks, and one-sixth (1/6) of such rate of pay for distant
location workweeks.

be made during the term of this Agreement. In the event of a dispute as
to relocation of a time clock, the matter shall be submitted to the
President of the IATSE and the President of the AMPTP for resolution.
When a designated time clock is established at a place other
than an employee’s department headquarters, work time shall be
computed from the time the employee is ordered to report to the
designated time clock location until dismissed at same location.
Employees shall be given sufficient time to travel to and from such

20. Meal Periods and Meals
The meal period provisions below apply to both “On Production”
and “Off Production” employees.
(a) Meal periods shall be not less than one-half (½) hour nor
more than one (1) hour in length. Not more than one (1) meal period
shall be deducted from work time for an employee during the minimum
call. A second meal period may be deducted from work time for those
employees who work in excess of the minimum call. The minimum
guarantee of work time after an evening meal shall be one and one-half
(1½) hours. This guarantee does not apply when such meal is supplied
at the Producer’s expense.
(b) The employee’s first meal period shall commence within six
(6) hours following the time of first call for the day; succeeding meal
periods for the same employee shall commence within six (6) hours after
the end of the preceding meal period. A twelve (12) minute grace period
may be called for production efficiency prior to imposition of any meal
penalty. Such grace period shall not be scheduled nor automatic nor is it
intended for everyday use. The twelve (12) minute grace period may not
be utilized when the meal period has been extended as permitted by
subparagraph (c) below. An employee’s first meal period shall
commence no earlier than two (2) hours after such employee reports for
work, except as provided in subparagraph (d) below.
The Producers and the IATSE agree that they will work with
the DGA and/or production executives on both the East and West Coasts
in an effort to ensure that employees are provided the opportunity to take
contractually-prescribed meal breaks. A meeting of representatives of
the AMPTP, IATSE and DGA to discuss the provision of meal breaks in
a timely manner to employees covered by the Basic Agreement shall
take place as soon as practicable but in no event later than January 31,
2022.
Upon the Local Union filing a claim that the Producer has
violated the foregoing, it shall immediately notify the designated
representative of the Producer. The Local Union and such representative
of the Producer shall meet or confer in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
In the event that no resolution is reached during such meeting or
conference, the Local Union or the Producer may, within three (3)
business days, request a hearing before a Special Committee consisting
- 39 -

--- PAGE 44 of 175 ---

of three (3) representatives designated by the AMPTP and three (3)
representatives designated by the IATSE.
The Special Committee shall investigate the facts of the case
and mediate the dispute. In the event that the Special Committee is
unable, through mediation, to achieve a resolution satisfactory to all
parties, then the Local Union may proceed to arbitration.
In addition, Producers agree that the IATSE may request
meetings on a Producer-by-Producer basis to discuss recurring issues
with the provision of meal breaks to employees covered by the Basic
Agreement.
(c) The meal interval may be extended one-half (½) hour without
penalty when used for wrapping up or to complete the camera take(s) in
progress, until print quality is achieved. Such extension shall not be
scheduled nor automatic. In the case of Gang Bosses and/or other “Off
Production” employees who normally overlap shifts, the meal interval
will be extended not to exceed one-half (½) hour without penalty.
(d) If any member of the company after commencement of work
time is given a reasonable hot breakfast, without deducting the time
spent in eating (30 minutes) from work time, then the first meal may be
six (6) hours after such breakfast, except that when such breakfast is
given within one (1) hour of the general crew call (either before or
after), the first meal for such employee shall be due at the same time as a
meal is due for the general crew. The parties hereby confirm that the
reference to “a reasonable hot breakfast” means a meal appropriate to
the time of day.
(e) When an “On Production” employee is away from home
studio, Producer will supply meals (except when work is at another
studio which has adequate meal facilities).
(f) When an “Off Production” employee on a nearby location is
required to work where convenient meal facilities are lacking, the
Producer will furnish meals unless employee is notified the night before
reporting for work that he is to work where such facilities are lacking.
However, in no event shall such employee be required to furnish more
than one meal per day.
(g) When the Producer furnishes meals to a shooting unit off any
lot, and an “Off Production” crew is working on the same site at the
same time for the same unit, the Producer will likewise furnish meals to
the “Off Production” crew.

III. DISTANT LOCATION MINIMUM WAGE SCALE
31. Distant Location Minimum Wage Scale
(a) “On Call” Employees
Employees hired under the “On Call” schedule shall receive,
in addition to their current studio rate, a distant location allowance of six
dollars ($6.00) per diem.
(b) The regular distant location workweek shall consist of any
six (6) consecutive days out of any seven (7) consecutive days,
commencing with the first of such six (6) days. However, the six (6)
consecutive day requirement shall not apply upon the commencement of
any regularly-scheduled six-day-per-week shift. (For example, on
starting a new shift, a schedule that provides for an employee to work on
Monday and Tuesday, with Wednesday as the regular day off, and is
followed by work on Thursday through the following Saturday, does not
violate the six (6) consecutive days requirement.)
(c) The day of departure and the day of return shall be
considered distant location days.
(d) Payment Provisions Applicable to the Sixth and Seventh
Days in an Employee’s Workweek on Distant Location and to Partial
Workweeks for Employees Hired under the “On Call” Schedule.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the following shall apply to employees hired under the “On Call”
schedule with respect to the sixth and seventh days in an employee’s
workweek on distant location, whether work is performed or not:

workweek during a full six (6) day workweek, employee shall receive an
amount equal to one and one-half times one-fifth (1/5) of the “on call”
weekly rate in effect in addition to the “on call” salary in effect.
(ii) For each sixth day not worked in an employee’s
workweek during a full six (6) day workweek, employee shall receive an
allowance equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the scheduled minimum “on
call” weekly rate, plus pension and health contributions for seven (7)
hours.
(iii) For each seventh day not worked in an
employee’s workweek, employee shall receive an allowance equal to
- 44 -

--- PAGE 49 of 175 ---

one-twelfth (1/12) of the scheduled minimum “on call” weekly rate, plus
pension and health contributions for eight (8) hours.
(iv) For each seventh day worked in an employee’s
workweek, if employee actually performs work at the direction of the
Producer, employee shall be paid an additional amount equal to one-
third (1/3) of the “on call” weekly rate in effect. Said amount shall be
paid in addition to any amount due for the sixth day in the employee’s
workweek on distant location pursuant to the above subparagraphs.
The term “rate in effect” means wage scale plus
amounts in excess of scale, if any.
Notwithstanding any agreement between
employee and Producer, the aggregate compensation paid to such
employee shall not be less than the scheduled studio weekly minimum
“on call” rate plus any additional compensation due for the sixth or
seventh day in the employee’s workweek as required hereinabove and
any additional compensation due for work on a recognized holiday as
required hereinbelow.
(2) Partial Workweek
In a partial workweek, five (5) days or less, consisting
of studio workdays and distant location workdays, studio days shall be
prorated at one-fifth (1/5) of the scheduled studio minimum salary rate
and distant location days shall be prorated at one-sixth (1/6) of such rate;
provided, however, that for any five (5) consecutive days within the
same payroll week, an employee shall be paid not less than the
scheduled studio minimum salary rate.
(3) “On Call” Employee Work on a Recognized Holiday
If an employee hired under the “On Call” schedule is
specifically instructed and required by Producer to perform work on a
recognized holiday on distant location, under the direction and control of
Producer, Producer shall pay such employee one-sixth (1/6) of his “on
call” weekly salary in effect for each such recognized holiday so
worked. Said amount shall be payable not later than the second
Thursday following the employee’s return to the studio.
(e) Hourly Employees
Studio wage rates and conditions shall apply on distant
location; provided, however, the following studio provisions shall not be
applicable on distant location:
- 45 -

--- PAGE 50 of 175 ---

(1) The sixth day worked in an employee’s workweek on
distant location is considered a straight time day.
(2) “Night Premiums” (Paragraph 5); and
(3) “Rest Periods” (Paragraph 10)

are guaranteed pay for the scheduled minimum call as work time for
each day of the regular workweek on distant location.

straight time pay allowance at the minimum wage rate (not work time)
for the sixth or seventh day not worked in the employee’s workweek,
plus pension and health contributions for eight (8) hours.
(c) Minimum call time and cumulative work time are recognized
as work time and employees shall hold themselves in readiness to serve
the Producer during such times.
(d) - (g) No Clauses.

on distant location, provided that the Producer has made
accommodations to allow employees to cash their pay checks on that

the United States, Canada and Mexico, employees shall be furnished
business class air transportation, except that when business class
accommodations are not available, employees shall travel first class.

travel time, reasonably comfortable riding conditions in the class of
transportation provided, avoiding overcrowding and providing proper
space for baggage and tools.
Producer will direct the employee that he must use the
Producer’s form of transportation to distant location. In those instances
in which Producer purchases public air transportation to and from such

The Producer shall provide accidental death insurance in a
sum not less than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for the
benefit of the employee’s designated beneficiary when the employee is

Employees shall be permitted to fill out a form specifying a
beneficiary. Such form shall be filed with the designated representative
of the Producer.
An employee, by refusing in good faith to travel by airplane,
will not jeopardize his future working opportunities on assignments
which do not require travel by airplane.
40. No Clause.
41. Call-backs (Rest Period)
The following provision applies when employees are employed on
a motion picture, program, part of a mini-series or episode of a series
which commences principal photography on or after February 13, 2022.
Otherwise, Paragraph 41 of the 2018 Agreement shall apply.
(a) Daily Rest Period on Distant Location
(1) The daily rest period shall be nine (9) hours on distant
location. If the daily rest period is invaded by no more than one (1)
hour, the employee shall be paid additional straight time for all such
invaded time. If the daily rest period is invaded by more than one (1)
hour, then the penalty shall be as provided in Paragraph 44(c).
(2) When the daily rest period is invaded, intervening time
of less than five (5) hours between dismissal and call-back to work shall
be work time; intervening time of five (5) or more hours shall not be
work time. When intervening time is less than five (5) hours, such time

*The above “call-back” guarantees for holidays and the
seventh day worked in an employee’s workweek do not apply when
employee reports to work on such days within the appropriate rest period
following dismissal from work starting on the previous day. In such
event, the “call-back” guarantee is the minimum call in hours as
specified in Paragraph 31.
By way of clarification, the parties agree that forced calls are
triggered by time worked, rather than time paid.
(b) Weekend Rest Period on Distant Location5
Paragraph 10(b) shall apply on distant location, except that
weekend rest periods on distant location shall be measured set-to-set or,
if the employee is not employed on a set, worksite-to-worksite, meaning
the measurement for the weekend rest period shall commence upon
dismissal at the set (or at the worksite) and end at call time at the set (or
at the worksite).
42. No Clause.
43. Sixth Day Worked on Distant Location

45. Meal Periods on Distant Location
(a) Meal periods (not counted as time worked) shall be not less
than one-half (½) hour nor more than one (1) hour. The first meal
period after reporting for work shall be called not later than six (6) hours
after reporting for work, and subsequent meal periods shall be called not
later than six (6) hours after the expiration of the previous meal period,
except the interval prior to the last meal period of the day may be
extended to six and one-half (6½) hours without penalty, provided the
employee performs no work on the shooting site after such meal. The
interval may also be extended one-half (½) hour when used for wrapping
up or to complete the camera take(s) in progress, until print quality is
achieved. Such extension shall not be scheduled nor automatic. In
addition, a twelve (12) minute grace period may be called for production
efficiency prior to imposition of any meal penalty. Such grace period
shall not be scheduled nor automatic nor is it intended for everyday use.
The twelve (12) minute grace period may not be utilized when the meal
period has been extended as permitted above.
Upon the Local Union filing a claim that the Producer has
violated the foregoing twelve (12) minute grace period, it shall
immediately notify the designated representative of the Producer. The
Local Union and such representative of the Producer shall meet or
confer in an attempt to resolve the dispute. In the event that no
resolution is reached during such meeting or conference, the Local
Union or the Producer may, within three (3) business days, request a
hearing before a Special Committee consisting of three (3)
representatives designated by the AMPTP and three (3) representatives
designated by the IATSE.
- 50 -

--- PAGE 55 of 175 ---

The Special Committee shall investigate the facts of the case
and mediate the dispute. In the event that the Special Committee is
unable, through mediation, to achieve a resolution satisfactory to all
parties, then the Local Union may proceed to arbitration.
(b) If an employee works less than nine and one-half (9½) hours
on a shift, only one meal is to be deducted. If he works nine and one-half
(9½) hours or more, more than one meal period may be deducted.

meals shall be computed as follows:
First one-half (½) hour meal delay or fraction
thereof............................................................ $ 7.50

thereof.......................................................... $ 10.00
Third and each succeeding one-half (½) hour meal

penalties for that employee in that workweek shall be compensated at
one (1) hour of pay at the prevailing rate for each one-half (½) hour of
meal delay or fraction thereof.
Such allowance shall be in addition to the compensation for
work time during the delay and shall not be applied as part of any
guarantee.
- 51 -

--- PAGE 56 of 175 ---

(d) If any member of the company after commencement of work
time is given a reasonable hot breakfast, without deducting the time
spent in eating (30 minutes) from work time, then the first meal may be
six (6) hours after such breakfast, except that when such breakfast is
given within one (1) hour of the general crew call (either before or
after), the first meal for such employee shall be due at the same time as a
meal is due for the general crew. The parties hereby confirm that the
reference to a “reasonable hot breakfast” means a meal appropriate to
the time of day.
(e) As an alternative to the foregoing provisions of this
Paragraph as they relate to “on production” employees, the Producer, at
its option, may institute “French hours” on a daily basis for “on
production” employees, with the approval of a majority of the IATSE-
represented crew. An employee’s consent to the use of a “French hours”
meal system shall not be a condition of employment.
46. Night Premiums on Distant Location
There are no night premiums on distant location.
47-50. No Clauses.
V. GENERAL CLAUSES
51. Hazardous Work
The employee selected to perform hazardous work and Producer
are to negotiate and agree upon a rate in advance for such work and, if
no agreement is so reached, the employee will not jeopardize working
opportunities by refusing to perform work that is considered hazardous.
The employee may request the assistance of the Business Representative
of the Union in such negotiations.
When an employee covered by this Agreement is working in close
proximity and is exposed to the same hazard with the same degree of
risk to which another employee covered by the Basic Agreement is
exposed who has negotiated a hazardous pay adjustment, the employee
covered by this Agreement is entitled to that same hazard pay
adjustment. In all other hazardous work situations, the amount of such
adjustment shall be the subject of individual negotiations.
If an employee is required to sign a waiver due to hazardous
conditions for any state or governmental agency or owner of private
property and refuses to sign such waiver, such employee may be
- 52 -

--- PAGE 57 of 175 ---

replaced, but such refusal shall not limit such employee’s future
employment opportunities with Producer.
When Producer knows in advance that such a waiver is required,
Producer will advise the Union of the situation.
52. Allowances for Hazardous Work
The following allowances shall be paid for hazardous work:
For taking motion pictures on aerial flights or submarine diving,
employee shall receive sixty dollars ($60.00) per flight or dive, but with
a maximum of payment in a single shift of one hundred eighty dollars
($180.00).
53. Abnormally Cold or Wet Work
Producer will provide suitable wearing apparel for abnormally cold
or wet work.
54. Overscale Employees
Rates of pay of overscale employees shall not be reduced by
reason of this wage agreement.
55-56. No Clauses.
57. Earnings Reports
At the end of each quarter, the Producer will submit a list of its
employees subject to this Agreement, showing each employee’s earnings
for that quarter.
58. Personal Service Contracts
Any personal service contract entered into between Producer and
Costume Designer shall conform, at least, to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, except as hereinafter expressly provided. The agreed-
upon compensation set forth in a personal service contract with a
Costume Designer may include and be in lieu of vacation pay, holiday
pay, pay for the sixth and/or seventh day worked in an employee’s
workweek, and severance pay called for by this Agreement, provided,
however, that it is clear from the terms of the personal service contract
that said benefits were expressly intended to be covered by the agreed-
upon compensation set forth in the personal service contract.
- 53 -

--- PAGE 58 of 175 ---

Producer shall supply a fully-executed copy of any personal
service contract entered into with an employee subject to this Agreement
to both the employee and the Guild.
59. Studio Pass
The duly authorized Business Representative of the Union shall be
furnished a pass to the studio. He shall be permitted to visit any portion
of the studio, lot or ranch necessary for the proper conduct of the
business of the Union during working hours.
60. Stewards
The Guild may designate or redesignate, as the case may be, an
employee subject to this Agreement as a Steward to inspect all working
conditions affecting the terms of this Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the Steward to settle minor grievances with the
designated representative of the Producer and, in the event such
grievance cannot be adjusted, to notify the Business Representative.
The Steward so designated shall be permitted to perform these duties,
but such duties shall not unduly interfere with his work.
61. No Clause.
62. Safety
(a) It is agreed by the parties that too great an emphasis cannot
be placed on the need to provide a safe working environment. In that
context, it shall be incumbent on each employer (herein referred to as the
Producer) to furnish employment and a place of employment which are
safe and healthful for the employees therein; to furnish and use safety
devices and safeguards, and adopt and use practices, means, methods,
operations and processes which are reasonably adequate to render such
employment and place of employment safe and healthful; to do every
other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, safety and health of
employees. Correspondingly, no employer shall require or permit any
employee to go or be in any employment or place of employment which
is not safe and healthful. In addition, every employer and every
employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards
and all rules, regulations and orders pursuant to applicable laws which
are applicable to his own actions and conduct; no person (employer or
employee) shall remove, displace, damage, destroy or carry off any
safety device, safeguard, notice or warning, furnished for the use in any
employment or place of employment; no person shall interfere with the
use of any method or process adopted for the protection of any
- 54 -

--- PAGE 59 of 175 ---

employee, including himself, in such employment or place of
employment.
(b) Rigid observance of safety regulations must be adhered to
and willful failure of any employee to follow safety rules and regulations
can lead to disciplinary action including discharge; however, no
employee shall be discharged or otherwise disciplined for refusing to
work on a job that exposes the individual to a clear and present danger to
life or limb, or for making a good faith report to the First Assistant
Director, the Unit Production Manager or his or her supervisor relating
to the safety of another employee exposed to a clear and present danger
to life and limb. No set of safety regulations; however, can
comprehensively cover all possible unsafe practices of working. The
Producer and the Union therefore undertake to promote in every way
possible the realization of the responsibility of the individual employee
with regard to preventing accidents to himself or his fellow employees.
For purposes of this Paragraph 62(b), the question of whether an
employee has made a report in good faith is subject to the grievance and
arbitration procedure set forth in Article 7 of this Agreement.
(c) It is also agreed that when unresolved or continuing disputes
exist regarding Safety and Health compliance, non-compliance or
interpretation therein of Title 8, Chapter 4, Subchapter 7, General
Industry Safety Orders, said disputes shall be referred to the AMPTP
and CSATF-administered Labor-Management Safety Committee for
review, investigation, interpretation and advisory recommendations to
the Employer(s). The CSATF-administered Labor Management Safety
Committee is the industry-wide Safety Committee consisting of the
IATSE and its West Coast Studio Local Unions, the Basic Crafts
Unions, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and
Radio Artists, the Directors Guild of America and representatives of the
Producers. It is understood that it is not the responsibility of the Safety
Committee, or any member of the Committee, the IATSE or its Local
Unions, the Basic Crafts, CSATF or the AMPTP to implement or
comply with any such recommendations.
(d) The Labor-Management Safety Committee shall meet at least
once a month.
(e) The cost of the Labor-Management Safety Committee will be
borne by CSATF.
(f) A separate bulletin shall be issued by the AMPTP to provide
the following:
- 55 -

--- PAGE 60 of 175 ---

(1) The Producers reaffirm their commitment to regularly
inspect the studio working areas and to establish preventive maintenance
procedures to assure safe working conditions.
(2) Complaints of unsafe conditions will be promptly
investigated by the Producer and appropriate action will be taken if the
Producer finds that an unsafe condition does exist.
(3) Each Producer will designate an individual as the
responsible safety officer for its respective studio, facility, laboratory or
location site. Except on location, each safety officer will have a well-
publicized “hot-line” phone number which employees can anonymously
call to alert management to any existing safety problems which may
require correction.
(4) The Producers will provide access to all working areas
to the Safety Director of CSATF so that he will periodically inspect
same.
(5) Communication regarding safety policy will be made
available to all affected employees directly or by posting on bulletin
boards.
(g) Concerns stemming from the use of smoke on sets shall be
referred to the industry-wide Safety Committee for resolution.
63-65. No Clauses.
66. Non-Discrimination
The parties agree to continue to comply with all applicable federal
and state laws relating to non-discriminatory employment practices.
Claims alleging a violation of this “Non-Discrimination” provision
are not subject to arbitration, but are instead subject to non-binding
mediation.
67. Foremen and Supervisory Employees
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution and By-
laws of the Union, or in the obligation taken by a person upon becoming
a member of the Union, or otherwise, which directly, indirectly or
impliedly places upon a foreman (or any person who is a supervisory
employee within the meaning of that term as set forth in the Labor
Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended), the duty or obligation
to accord an unlawful employment preference to members of the Union,
- 56 -

--- PAGE 61 of 175 ---

such foreman or supervisory employee shall not give or recommend any
unlawful employment preference and the Union shall not in any manner
discipline or threaten with discipline any such foreman or supervisory
employee for failing or refusing to give or recommend any such
unlawful employment preference.
68. Preference of Employment
The Producer, in the hiring of Costume Designers, shall give
preference of employment to qualified Costume Designers. For
purposes of this provision only, a “qualified Costume Designer” is
defined as a person who has had prior employment as a Costume
Designer in the production of a motion picture (as defined in the
Producer - I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic Agreement), television or
legitimate theatre at least once during a period of three (3) years prior to
the date of the proposed employment. For these purposes, screen credit
alone shall not be determinative proof of such prior employment.
In order to assist the Producer in locating qualified Costume
Designers, the Guild will, on a current basis, supply to the Producer an
availability list containing the names of currently available qualified
Costume Designers. Prior to selecting a Costume Designer for a
production, the Producer will give good faith consideration to the
Costume Designers on the current availability list supplied by the Guild.
The decision as to whether or not to employ a person from said
availability list shall be in the sole discretion of the Producer.
The foregoing preference of employment requirement shall not
apply to the employment of a person who: (a) has had sufficient training
and/or experience so as to qualify for a career as a professional Costume
Designer, and (b) such person intends to be currently available for
employment in the motion picture industry.
The parties hereby confirm that an employee on permanent
disability status with one Producer may not work for another Producer in
the same craft.
69. No Clause.
70. Reporting of Accidents
The nature and place of hospitalization of all accident cases
requiring hospitalization shall be reported to the Union as soon as
practicable after the accident. An employee who is injured while at
work hereunder shall be credited with not less than a minimum call on
the day of such injury.
- 57 -

--- PAGE 62 of 175 ---

71. Employees in the Armed Services
Recognizing the moral and legal responsibility to the employees
subject to this Agreement who have entered into the Armed Services, the
Producer and the Union agree that they have a joint responsibility
(subject to the then-existing statutes) in the reinstatement of such
employees to the jobs such employees held prior to their entry into the
Armed Services.
Producers and the Union agree that employees temporarily holding
such jobs will be displaced by such returning employees.
72. Vacations
Vacations with pay will be allowed to employees not under a
written personal service contract as follows:
(a) Daily Schedule Employees
(1) Vacation pay for a person employed solely under a
Daily Schedule shall be computed at the rate of four percent (4%) of
total annual earnings for those hours worked at straight time, including
hours worked on night premiums at straight time and hours paid as
vacation time, during the employee’s personal income tax reporting
year.
(2) Employees must actually take time off from work for
paid vacations in accordance with the following schedule:
For Daily Schedule Employees
Straight time hours worked in Straight time
preceding year: working days
required to be
taken off:
1,928.0 and over (inclusive) 10

--- PAGE 64 of 175 ---

In addition, one (1) workday shall be counted for each paid vacation
day.
**Employees who are employed less than twenty-one (21)
days and who do not qualify for a day’s vacation pay under this
provision shall be paid vacation pay as follows:
Daily Schedule Employment: 4% of straight time
earnings including
hours worked on
night premiums at
straight time.
Weekly Schedule Employment: 4% of guaranteed
weekly earnings.
(c) To determine, for vacation purposes, the number of days
worked in any workweek, the following formulae shall be used:
(1) Daily Schedule Employees (who also worked under a
weekly schedule in the preceding year):
Studio Employment
5 x Total hours worked at straight time (including
40 hours worked on weekday night premiums) to a
maximum of 40 hours.
(2) “On Call” Weekly Employees:
Days worked are equal to the number of days paid for
days other than the sixth and seventh days worked in the employee’s
workweek.
(d) To determine, for vacation purposes, the rate at which each
vacation day shall be paid, the following formulae shall be used:
(1) Weekly Schedule Employees, including Daily Schedule
employees, who also worked under a weekly schedule in the preceding
year: one (1) day is equal to eight (8) hours average pay at straight time.
(2) Rates of pay shall be those in effect during the year in
which the vacation is earned (“preceding year”).
- 60 -

--- PAGE 65 of 175 ---

(3) “On Call” Weekly Schedule Employees: One (1) day is
equal to pay of one-fifth (1/5) of weekly rate in effect at start of
vacation.
(e) Additional Vacation Provisions
The following additional vacation provisions shall apply to
Weekly or Daily Schedule employees who meet the necessary eligibility
qualifications:
(1) Eligibility Requirements
Commencing with vacations earned in the year 1979
and payable in the year 1980 and thereafter, eligible employees shall be
those employees who actually worked for Producer for eight (8)
consecutive “eligible” years, with an aggregate of not less than 1,600
“straight time” days worked with Producer in such eight (8) years.
As used in this provision, the term “year” shall mean
the employee’s personal income tax earnings year (also hereinafter
referred to as “tax year”); the term “eligible year” shall mean a tax year
in which the employee worked one hundred (100) or more “straight
time” days for Producer;6 the term “straight time” days shall be deemed
to include the five (5) or six (6) days of employment, as the case may be,
specified under the respective five (5) or six (6) day cumulative weekly
schedules.
Any tax year in which the employee actually works
less than one hundred (100) “straight time” days for Producer shall be
excluded in computing the required eight (8) “eligible” tax years, and
the “straight time” days worked in such year shall not be counted in
computing the required aggregate of 1,600 “straight time” days to be
worked in such eight (8) tax years.
Employees who fail to work more than one hundred
(100) “straight time” days for such employer in each of any two (2)
consecutive tax years shall, at the end of such second year, be
considered new employees hereunder with no previous employment
credit with Producer for the purpose of establishing the above eligibility
6 The term “eligible year” shall be applied in the following manner with respect to
calendar year 1988 to take account of the WGA strike: As to calendar year 1988 only, an
employee shall be deemed to have an “eligible year” if he has worked at least seven-twelfths
(7/12) of the number of days otherwise required under Paragraph 72(e) to attain an eligible year.
Thus, any employee who has worked 58 or more “straight time” days for Producer during
calendar year 1988 shall be deemed to have an “eligible year” for purposes of the additional
vacation provision.
- 61 -

--- PAGE 66 of 175 ---

requirements. Provided, however, that in determining such two (2)
consecutive years, no year shall be included (and the “straight time”
days worked in such year shall not be counted for any eligibility
purposes hereunder) in which the employee could not work one hundred
(100) “straight time” days for Producer due to either or both of the
following:
(i) The period of recorded leaves of absence granted
by Producer;
(ii) For the period during which the employee was
absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of
an “industrial accident” occurring to such employee while employed by
Producer.
(2) Vacation Days and Pay
Commencing with October 26, 1955, such weekly or
daily employees who become eligible on or after such date, as above
provided, shall, beginning with the date they so become eligible, earn
with Producer fifty percent (50%) more in vacation time and money
based upon the applicable weekly or daily employee7 vacation schedule
set forth above; any such employee shall be limited to earning a
maximum of only fifteen (15) days vacation per year. Provided, that for
the remainder of any such tax year in which such an employee becomes
eligible, he shall only earn additional vacation time and money, as above
provided, based solely on the “straight time” days he worked for
Producer after he so became eligible and within the remaining portion of
each year, to be computed separate and apart at the rate of one-half of
the vacation benefit specified under the above applicable daily or weekly
vacation schedule.
(3) Loss of Eligibility
Employees who become eligible, as above provided,
but who thereafter either resign from employment with Producer or fail
to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty (150) “straight time”
days8 in any one (1) tax year shall, as of the last day of such tax year or,
in the case of resignation, the date of such resignation, lose such
7 Vacation pay for such employee employed solely under a daily schedule shall be
computed at the rate of 6.2762% instead of 4% as set forth in subparagraph (a)(1), above, of this
Paragraph 72.
8 For purposes of calendar year 1988, the “more than one hundred fifty (150) ‘straight
time’ days” requirement shall be reduced to “more than eighty-eight (88) ‘straight time’ days” to
take account of the WGA strike.
- 62 -

--- PAGE 67 of 175 ---

eligibility and right to earn the additional vacation days and pay above
provided; in such event, they shall thereupon be considered new
employees hereunder with no previous employment credit with Producer
for the purpose of subsequently establishing the above eligibility
requirements.
In determining whether any employee loses his
eligibility for failure to work for Producer more than one hundred fifty
(150) “straight time” days in a tax year, as above provided, no such year
shall be counted for this purpose in which the employee could not work
at least one hundred fifty-one (151) “straight time” days for Producer
due to either or both of the following:
(i) The period of recorded leaves of absence granted
such employee by Producer;
(ii) The period during which such employee was
absent and physically unable to work for Producer solely as a result of
an “industrial accident” occurring to him while employed by Producer.
(4) Eligibility Credit
For the purposes of determining “eligible” years and
“loss of eligibility” only, as above provided, employees who leave the
employ of Producer to perform military service and who remain in the
Armed Forces of the United States in accordance with the applicable
National Selective Service Act (or other subsequently enacted
comparable national legislation then in effect pertaining to such service),
shall be credited as having worked for Producer the number of
applicable days the employee would normally have been employed by
Producer for “straight time” days in each workweek of the period of
such service.
(f) Daily and Weekly Schedule Employees
(1) Vacations are earned in one personal income tax
earnings year and are paid for in the succeeding calendar year.
(2) Vacations shall not be cumulative between calendar
years and shall be taken at times approved by the Producer.
(3) Days that would otherwise constitute the sixth or
seventh day worked in an employee’s workweek and holidays occurring
during vacation periods are not counted as days granted.
- 63 -

--- PAGE 68 of 175 ---

(4) When any portion of the vacation period is less than a
full payroll week, by mutual agreement between the Producer and the
employee, the Producer may grant leave of absence without pay for the
remaining fractional portion of the payroll week.
(5) Eligible employees who are no longer employed at the
beginning of the calendar year in which their vacation pay for the
preceding year is payable may obtain such vacation pay at any time
subsequent to March 15 by notifying the Producer of their desire to
obtain such vacation pay. Such notice shall set forth a date on or
subsequent to the date of notice for the commencement of the period to
which such vacation pay shall apply. The designation of such
commencement date shall be at the sole discretion of such employees,
and the Producer agrees to pay such employees the vacation pay due on
or prior to such commencement date, but in no event shall the Producer
be obligated to make such payment prior to March 15.
(6) In the event of a layoff, an employee eligible for
vacation shall not be required to take vacation at time of layoff.
(7) Each eligible employee shall, if he so desires, submit to
his department head, prior to June 1st, three (3) vacation dates in the
order of his preference. In the event that none of the three (3)
preferential dates is granted, the department head may establish date of
vacation if conditions permit. However, he shall give any such
employee not less than one week’s notice as to date of vacation unless,
upon the request of the employee, it is otherwise mutually agreed.
Employees who do not submit preferential dates shall receive vacations
on dates subject to the discretion of the department head.
(8) Producer shall pay an eligible employee his vacation
pay check not later than noon of the pay day preceding the
commencement day of his vacation, provided the employee has made a
request to Producer for such vacation check at least one (1) week prior to
such pay day preceding the commencement of such vacation.
(9) If a successor company buys out Producer and
continues the operation of Producer’s studio, and if the buying company
continues the employment at the studio of an employee of Producer,
such employee shall retain with the buying company his appropriate
vacation pay experience credit accrued with the selling company. If
such employee is not so continued in employment by the buying
company, then only Producer is responsible for any vacation pay due the
employee at the time of his termination. If such employee is offered
employment by the buying company, but elects not to continue his
- 64 -

--- PAGE 69 of 175 ---

employment with the buying company, he shall be entitled to his
accrued vacation pay from Producer.
(10) Presentation of Claim for Vacation and/or Holiday Pay
(i) Producers that currently pay for vacations and/or
holidays on a weekly basis shall continue to adhere to their existing
practice. Producers that currently make vacation and/or holiday
payments pursuant to subparagraph (f)(10)(ii) below may instead elect
on a production-by-production basis to pay on a weekly basis.
(ii) Producers that currently pay for vacations and/or
holidays at the end of the calendar year shall elect one of the following
procedures for employees on layoff and for employees on payroll:
(A) With respect to employees on layoff:
(1) On or after March 15 of the year
following the calendar year in which vacation and/or holiday pay was
earned, the Producer shall either:
(a) Mail or deliver to such employee
his vacation and/or holiday pay; or
(b) Notify each such employee that
he should claim his vacation and/or holiday pay pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement.
(2) In the event the Producer mails the
employee’s vacation and/or holiday paycheck and it is returned or if the
employee fails, within thirty (30) days following the date of mailing of
the notice referred to in subparagraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(1)(b) above, to
claim his/her vacation and/or holiday pay, the Producer shall notify the
Local Union of the names of those employees who have not claimed
vacation and/or holiday pay. In the case of employees whose checks
were returned, the Producer shall also forward the returned check(s) to
the Local Union.
(3) The Local Union shall endeavor to
locate any employee who has not claimed his vacation and/or holiday
pay. If it does so, it shall forward to the employee his check or
otherwise advise the employee of the department of the Producer to
contact to claim such pay.
(4) If the Local Union is unable, within
thirty (30) days following its receipt of the notice referred to in
- 65 -

--- PAGE 70 of 175 ---

subparagraph (f)(10)(ii)(A)(2) above, to locate such employee(s), the
Local Union shall so advise the Producer and return any unclaimed
check(s) to the Producer.
(5) On or about March 15 of the second
calendar year following the year in which vacation and/or holiday pay
was earned (“the second calendar year”), employees who have not
claimed their vacation and/or holiday pay will be notified that unless
claimed by July 15 of that year, such pay will be sent to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension Plan. On or about May 15 of the second
calendar year, Producer will furnish to the Local Union a list showing
the names of those employees who have not claimed vacation and/or
holiday pay and the amount of holiday and/or vacation pay due to each,
together with a notice that unless claimed by July 15, such holiday
and/or vacation pay will be sent to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
Plan.
(6) On or about July 15 of the second
calendar year, unclaimed vacation and/or holiday pay will be contributed
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and credited to the
appropriate employee pension plan account. Money so contributed shall
not be returned to the employee and shall fully discharge the Producer’s
and the Local Union’s obligations hereunder to the employee with
respect to the payment of vacation and/or holiday pay.
(B) With respect to employees on payroll:
(1) On or after March 15 of the year
following the calendar year in which vacation and/or holiday pay was
earned, the Producer shall either:
(a) mail or deliver to such employee
his vacation and/or holiday pay; or
(b) notify each such employee that
he should request holiday pay pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement and schedule his vacation according to this Agreement.
(2) In the event the employee fails to
request such holiday pay and/or to schedule his vacation within thirty
(30) days after the date of mailing of the notice referred to in
subparagraph (f)(10)(ii)(B)(1)(b) above, the Producer shall notify the
Local Union of the names of those employees who have not claimed
such pay and/or scheduled their vacation.
- 66 -

--- PAGE 71 of 175 ---

(3) The Local Union shall, within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the notice referred to in subparagraph
(f)(10)(ii)(B)(2) above, endeavor to notify the employee and advise him
to claim holiday pay and to schedule his vacation.
(4) On or about March 15 of the second
calendar year, employees who have not claimed their vacation and/or
holiday pay will be notified that unless claimed by July 15 of that year,
such pay will be sent to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan. On or
about May 15 of the second calendar year, Producer will furnish to the
Local Union a list showing the names of those employees who have not
claimed vacation and/or holiday pay and the amount of vacation and/or
holiday pay due to each, together with a notice that unless claimed by
July 15, such holiday and/or vacation pay will be sent to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension Plan.
(5) On or about July 15 of the second
calendar year, unclaimed vacation and/or holiday pay will be contributed
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and credited to the
appropriate employee pension plan account. Money so contributed shall
not be returned to the employee and shall fully discharge the Producer’s
and Local Union’s obligations hereunder with respect to the payment of
vacation and/or holiday pay.
(iii) New signatory Producers shall adhere to the
practice of paying vacation and/or holiday pay currently on a weekly
basis unless other arrangements are made by them with the IATSE.
73. Jurisdictional Disputes
The Union agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Producer and
other Local Unions in the industry in working out a method for the
determination of jurisdictional disputes without work stoppages.
Appropriate clauses shall be incorporated in this Agreement to
cover any method or means that shall be agreed upon.
73.1 Letter of Understanding re Procedure for Implementing
Paragraph 73
(a) If a jurisdictional dispute should arise between or among the
West Coast Studio Local Unions, it will be submitted to the IATSE for
resolution.
(b) Prior to rendering a decision thereon, the IATSE shall notify
the AMPTP of the existence of the dispute and, upon request of the
- 67 -

--- PAGE 72 of 175 ---

AMPTP, shall consider the position of the Producer concerning the
dispute.
(c) In the event that the AMPTP disagrees with the IATSE
decision as to which Local should be assigned the work, the IATSE
agrees to meet with the AMPTP in a good faith effort to resolve the
question.
73.2 Handling of Disputes over “Copying” or “Redesign” Work
(a) Disputes over the assignment of alleged “copying” or
“redesign” work to persons employed under the Local 705 or Local 892
Agreements shall be handled in the following manner:
(1) Representatives of the Producer, Local 705 and Local
892 shall meet as a tripartite committee in an effort to resolve any such
dispute. All such disputes shall be referred to this committee.
(2) If the committee unanimously agrees that the Producer
has incorrectly assigned the work in dispute, then the remedy for such
violation shall be the difference between the then-current weekly rate
(i.e., the rate in effect at the time the work was performed) of a Costume
Designer and the then-current weekly rate (i.e., the rate in effect at the
time the work was performed) of a Costumer (Occ. Code #2305).
(3) In the event that the committee is unable to resolve the
dispute or if the aggrieved Local Union believes that the remedy
provided in subparagraph (2) is inadequate, then the aggrieved Local
Union and/or the Producer shall have the right to submit the dispute to
the President of the AMPTP and the President of the IATSE for a final
and binding decision, which shall be issued in writing, as to whether the
work in dispute was appropriately assigned. The Presidents shall jointly
have the right to award an appropriate remedy as to any or all the parties.
74. Severance Pay
(a) General
(1) (i) An employee employed by the Producer under
this Agreement or its predecessor agreements for one or more qualified
years (as defined in subparagraph (f) hereof) whose employment is
severed after August 1, 2021; or
(ii) an employee who had at least one (1) qualified
year (as defined in Paragraph 74(f) of this Agreement) as of August 1,
1985 who has made the required application for retirement to the Motion
- 68 -

--- PAGE 73 of 175 ---

Picture Industry Pension Plan at least sixty (60) days prior to retiring or
has made the required application for retirement to any private
retirement plan referred to in Article XV of the Trust Agreement of the
Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan and who retires
shall receive the applicable severance pay set forth below (as modified
by subparagraphs (c) and (d) hereof) unless such employee is
disqualified for severance pay purposes pursuant to subparagraph (e)
hereof.
Qualified Years Number of Weeks of
Severance Pay

The rate at which severance pay is payable shall
be determined in the same manner as the rate at which vacation pay is
determined under the vacation pay provisions of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the base period used in computing the
employee’s average earnings shall, for the purpose of severance pay, be
based on the twelve (12) consecutive month period ending on the date of
severance, instead of the employee’s personal income tax earnings year
used in computing vacation pay.
(2) Ninety (90) elapsed days after severance occurs such
employee shall be entitled to:
(i) one (1) week of said severance pay if he has two
(2) or less qualified years as of date of severance;
(ii) two (2) weeks of said severance pay if he has
three (3) or more qualified years as of date of severance; provided,
- 69 -

--- PAGE 74 of 175 ---

however, such employee shall not receive such severance pay if within
such ninety (90) day period he receives the following employment by
Producer:
(A) five (5) days’ employment, not necessarily
consecutive, if he has one (1) or two (2) qualified years as of the date of
such severance;
(B) eight (8) days’ employment, not necessarily
consecutive, if he has three (3) qualified years as of the date of such
severance;
(C) ten (10) days’ employment, not necessarily
consecutive, if he has four (4) or more qualified years as of the date of
such severance.
(3) If such employee entitled to severance pay after ninety
(90) elapsed days has five (5) or more qualified years as of the date of
severance, he shall be entitled to the balance of his accrued severance
pay ninety (90) elapsed days following the completion of the first ninety
(90) day period, unless during the second ninety (90) day period he
receives fifteen (15) days’ employment by Producer, not necessarily
consecutive.
(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (2)
and (3) above, an employee who retires in accordance with subparagraph
(a)(1)(ii) above shall receive severance pay within thirty (30) days
following his retirement.
(b) Payment of Full Severance Pay
Once an employee has received full accrued severance pay,
pursuant to subparagraph (a) above, he shall thereafter be a new
employee for severance pay purposes and future computation of
qualified years shall apply only to employment by Producer, if any, after
the receipt of such full severance pay.
An employee who retires pursuant to subparagraph (a)(1)(ii)
above and receives his full accrued severance pay shall be removed from
the Industry Experience Roster and the Studio Seniority Roster of the
Producers.
(c) Offset
If an employee on the date of severance of employment with
Producer after January 31, 1961 would otherwise already have five (5)
- 70 -

--- PAGE 75 of 175 ---

or more qualified years with Producer, he shall be entitled to the total
number of weeks of severance pay, as provided in (a) above, less an
“offset” in the number of weeks of any severance pay he received from
Producer before January 31, 1961 in connection with employment which
is considered in the computation of such qualified years or with
“bridged” years as referred to in subparagraph (f) hereof. This “offset”
shall apply only towards payments due after the completion of the
second of two ninety (90) day periods referred to in subparagraph (a)(3)
above. In this instance, payment by Producer of full severance pay to
employee prior to January 31, 1961 shall not break the employee’s
employment with such Producer for purposes of computing consecutive
qualified years hereunder.
(d) Reduction of Severance Pay Amounts
Any severance pay paid to an employee after January 31,
1961 shall correspondingly reduce the total number of weeks of
severance pay to which he is thereinafter entitled before again becoming
a new employee hereunder. An employee who receives or has received
full severance pay hereunder after January 31, 1961 shall be considered
to be a new employee thereafter for severance pay purposes.
(e) Disqualification for Severance Pay
Employees hereunder shall be disqualified for severance pay
in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) below.
(1) Refusal of Offers of Employment
If an employee rejects an offer of employment from
Producer hereunder during either of the ninety (90) day periods referred
to in subparagraph (a)(3) hereof, such employee shall lose his
qualification for severance pay and, if subsequently rehired, shall be
rehired as a new employee for severance pay purposes. If any employee
was not available or could not be reached when called for work by
Producer, he shall be deemed to have rejected an offer of employment;
provided, however, that:
(i) Producer shall be obligated, in the event of such
rejection or unavailability, to notify the Union on the same day by
telephone unless the Union office is not open, in which case such
notification must be made on the next following workday, and to
confirm such call by letter posted on the day of such notification to the
Union.
- 71 -

--- PAGE 76 of 175 ---

(ii) If Producer is unable to reach the employee
(including such inability to reach because no one answers employee’s
telephone), Producer shall be obligated to telephone the Union and
request the Union to make the call, in which event the Union shall either
promptly confirm to the Producer by telephone its inability to reach the
employee or advise the Producer by telephone that it has reached the
employee and of the results of such call.
(iii) It is recognized that in certain circumstances it
may be difficult for an employee to accept a call immediately when he is
currently employed at another studio. It is further recognized that in
certain circumstances it may be difficult for the employee, as well as a
hardship to the studio at which he is then employed, to be required to
accept a call immediately without any notice to his then present
employer. It is believed that in the great majority of cases reasonable
consideration would be given so that the employee would not lose his
severance pay credits. To this end, it is the intent of the parties hereto
that if an employee who is qualified for severance pay has been laid off
by a studio and, within either of the ninety (90) day periods referred to,
such studio recalls the employee at a time when such employee is unable
to accept such recall because of other employment in the motion picture
industry, then either of such ninety (90) day periods shall be deemed
extended by a period equivalent to the period of employment for which
the employee was being recalled, but in no event to exceed twenty (20)
days. In the event such employee is again recalled within either of the
ninety (90) day periods and does not accept such recall because of other
employment in the motion picture industry, or for any other reason
except as otherwise herein provided, then such employee shall lose his
qualification for severance pay and, in the event he is subsequently
rehired by the Producer, then such rehire shall be as a new employee for
severance pay purposes, except that if the employee’s call was on a daily
basis, there may be two (2) extensions of either of the ninety (90) day
periods by reason of inability to accept calls because of employment
elsewhere in the motion picture industry.
(iv) If the employee is unavailable to accept such
recall because of employment outside the motion picture industry at the
time of such recall, he shall have a maximum of two (2) days after the
date of such recall to make himself available and, if he fails to do so,
then such employee shall lose his qualification for severance pay and, if
he is subsequently rehired, shall be a new employee for severance pay
purposes.
- 72 -

--- PAGE 77 of 175 ---

(2) Severance Beyond Control of Producer
In the event any severance is the result of a dismissal
due to seniority requirements, a voluntary resignation or a layoff as a
result of physical incapacity, epidemic, fire, action of the elements,
strike,9 walkouts, labor dispute, governmental order, court order or order
of any other legally constituted body, act of God, public enemy, war,
riot, civil commotion or for any other cause beyond the control of the
Producer, whether of the same or any other nature, the employee shall
not be entitled to any severance pay arising out of the completion of both
of the ninety (90) day periods following such severance. In the event
any severance is the result of dismissal for cause, the employee so
severed shall be disqualified for severance pay.
(f) Qualified Years
As used herein, the term “qualified years,”10 with respect to
any employee, shall refer to the number of consecutive periods of three
hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days each, calculated backward
from the date of his severance, in each of which the employee has been
employed by Producer for two hundred (200) or more work days
(including paid vacation days as work days); it being understood and
agreed that if, in any such three hundred sixty-five (365) day period,
such employee was employed for less than two hundred (200) work days
by Producer, such three hundred sixty-five (365) day period shall not be
counted as a qualified year but shall be “bridged” for severance pay
purposes, with the result that any such three hundred sixty-five (365)
day period or periods prior to such “bridged” year in which employee
was employed by Producer for two hundred (200) or more work days
shall be counted as a qualified year; provided, however, that any three
hundred sixty-five (365) day period in which employee received any
authorized leave of absence without pay shall be extended by the length
of such leave and provided, further, that the computation of qualified
years shall be subject to the following exceptions:
9 The 1988 strike by the Writers Guild of America shall not be considered a disqualifying
event for purposes of severance pay. Instead, any periods provided in Paragraph 74 shall be
tolled for the duration of the WGA strike (March 7, 1988 through August 7, 1988).
10 The definition of a “qualified year,” for purposes of this Paragraph 74(f), shall be
applied in the following manner with respect to calendar year 1988 to take account of the Writers
Guild of America strike: As to calendar year 1988 only, an employee shall be deemed to have a
“qualified year” if he has worked at least seven-twelfths (7/12) of the number of days otherwise
required under this Paragraph to attain a “qualified year.” Thus, any employee who has worked
one hundred seventeen (117) or more work days during calendar year 1988 shall be deemed to
have a “qualified year” for purposes of this provision.
- 73 -

--- PAGE 78 of 175 ---

(1) If an employee is determined to have less than two (2)
qualified years, he shall be credited with a qualified year only if, in
addition to having been employed for at least two hundred (200) or more
days in the three hundred sixty-five (365) days immediately preceding
his date of severance, he shall have been employed for at least one (1)
day during the first six (6) months of the eighteen (18) month period
immediately preceding his date of severance, in which case he shall be
credited with one (1) qualified year.
(2) Any period of two hundred seventy (270) consecutive
days commencing prior to January 31, 1961 in which such employee
was not actually employed by Producer will be deemed to have broken
the employment record of such employee and no period prior to the
completion of such two hundred seventy (270) days shall be considered
in determining qualified years of such employee.
(3) With respect to any severance of employment of an
employee which occurred between February 1, 1961 and January 31,
1965, both dates inclusive, the passage of two hundred seventy (270)
days following such severance in which such employee was not
employed and did not receive an offer of comparable employment under
the terms and conditions specified in the predecessor collective
bargaining agreement of this Agreement shall result in his being a new
employee for severance pay purposes upon the completion of such two
hundred seventy (270) day period.
(4) If an employee on the date of the severance of his
employment under this Agreement after January 31, 1961 with Producer
would otherwise have had one (1), two (2), three (3) or four (4)
consecutive “qualified years” with Producer, but had received full
severance pay prior to February 1, 1965, then he shall be deemed to be a
new employee for severance pay purposes after being rehired and the
applicable consecutive qualified years shall be based and computed only
upon his employment with Producer after he so became such a new
employee.
(g) Severance Obligation of Successor Company
If a successor company buys out Producer and continues the
operation of Producer’s studio, and if the buying company continues the
employment at the studio of an employee of Producer, such employee
shall retain with the buying company his appropriate severance pay
experience credit accrued with Producer and his employment shall not
be considered to be terminated for severance pay purposes as a result of
such successor company’s acquisition of Producer. If such employee is
not so continued in employment by the buying company, then Producer
- 74 -

--- PAGE 79 of 175 ---

is responsible for any severance pay due the employee at the time of his
termination. If such employee is offered employment by the buying
company, but elects not to continue his employment with the buying
company, he shall not be entitled to any severance pay from either
Producer or buying company.
(h) Presentation of Claim for Severance Pay
Any claim for the payment of severance pay, not presented to
the Producer within three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after
the date upon which the employee is qualified under this Paragraph for
such severance pay, shall be deemed to be waived.
75. No Clause.
76. Re-employment of Former Labor Union Officers
Any employee who has been employed by the Producer for the
twelve (12) consecutive months (and has actually received pay for two
hundred (200) or more days in that period) immediately prior to the date
of his election or appointment to a paid full-time job with a labor
organization in the motion picture industry shall be re-employed in his
former job within ninety (90) days after leaving his Union position, on
the same basis and seniority as though he had never left such job with
Producer. Provided, however, that such job is available at the time of
request for re-employment; that the job is not then held by an employee
holding a personal service contract; that the employee, in the opinion of
the Producer, is qualified and able to perform the duties required in such
job, and that such employee has made application within thirty (30) days
of leaving his Union position.
If such position has been abolished or the labor requirements of the
Producer have materially changed, then subject to the above conditions,
the Producer will give such employee preference of employment for any
job available within the classifications of the bargaining unit.
77. Return of Transferred Employee to Bargaining Unit
Any employee of the Producer subject to this Agreement who is
transferred or promoted to a position with Producer outside the
classifications of the bargaining unit may, at the sole discretion of the
Producer, upon the termination of such transfer or promotion, be
restored to a position within the classifications of the bargaining unit on
the same basis and seniority as though he had never been transferred or
promoted from such bargaining unit. Provided, however, that such
employee makes application with Producer for reinstatement to such
- 75 -

--- PAGE 80 of 175 ---

position within the bargaining unit within ninety (90) days after
severance from the position to which he had been transferred or
promoted, as above described.
78. No Clause.
79. Leave of Absence
A regular employee’s request for a leave of absence, not to exceed
six (6) months, will be given consideration by the Producer, and the
Producer will not unreasonably refuse to grant such a leave of absence
for good cause, provided the employee’s services can be reasonably
spared. All such leaves of absence will be in writing. No such leave of
absence will be extended beyond six (6) months, except for compelling
reasons.
80-83. No Clauses.
84. Screen Credit
No screen credit as/or implying rendition of services as a Costume
Designer on a motion picture subject to this Agreement shall be given to
an individual other than a Costume Designer. This shall not imply any
mandatory screen credit. However, if screen credit is given, it shall be in
one of the following forms: “Costumes Designed by...,” “Costumes
by...” or “Costume Designer.”
85-86. No Clauses.
87. Design Authentication
The Costume Designer or Sketch Artist may affix the Costume
Designers Guild emblem on sketches wherever practical. However, it
shall not be a violation of this Agreement if such emblem is not so
affixed.
88-94. No Clauses.

EXHIBIT “B”
GUIDELINES REGARDING EXTENDED WORK DAYS
Theatrical and television productions are budgeted for specified hours of
production. There are cost deterrents which encourage the production to
be on budget and on time.
When an extended work day is necessary, the need for same should be
identified as far in advance as possible so that appropriate planning may
occur.
The following guidelines set forth common sense measures which
should be considered when extended work days are necessitated:
1. Sleep deprivation, which may be caused by factors other than an
extended work day, should be identified by the employee. The
American Automobile Association (AAA) cautions drivers as to
the following danger signs:
• Eyes closing by themselves
• Difficulty in paying attention
• Frequent yawning
• Swerving in lane
AAA warns that drivers experiencing any of these danger signs
could fall asleep at any time. AAA recommends three basic
solutions - sleep, exercise and caffeine. AAA urges drivers who are
too drowsy to drive safely to pull off the road to a safe area, lock
the doors and take a nap - even twenty minutes will help. Upon
waking, the driver should get some exercise and consume caffeine
for an extra boost.
2. Any employee who believes that he/she is too tired to drive safely
should notify an authorized representative of the Producer before
leaving the set. In that event, the Producer will endeavor to find
alternative means of transportation or provide a hotel room or a
place to rest. Such request may be made without any fear of
reprisal and will not affect any future employment opportunities.
3. When the production company anticipates an extended work day,
the employees should be encouraged to carpool.
4. When an extended work day is necessary, appropriate beverages
and easily metabolized foods should be available.

Re: Special Conditions for Long-Form Television Motion Pictures (Including

TECHNICIANS, ARTISTS AND ALLIED CRAFTS OF THE UNITED STATES, ITS
TERRITORIES AND CANADA, AFL-CIO ("IATSE").
WHEREAS the Producer is a signatory party to the Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement
of 2021 and the West Coast Studio Local Agreements; and
WHEREAS special conditions exist regarding productions of made-for-television long-
form programs, and of long-form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which
are budgeted at $9,000,000 or less, as further described below, concerning whether such
programs or motion pictures will be produced by the Producer; and
WHEREAS special conditions exist in order to preserve and maintain employment for

provided that no commitment for a series is attached to the pilot order*), as well
as to long-form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which
are budgeted at $9,000,000 or less, which are produced by the Producer in Los
Angeles during the term of the 2021 IATSE Basic Agreement. Additionally, for
made-for-home video productions budgeted at no more than $12,000,000,
Producer may elect to use the terms of the Low Budget Theatrical Agreement as
provided in the Sideletter re Made-For-Home Video Productions.
2. All of the terms and conditions of the IATSE Basic Agreement of 2021 and the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements shall apply, except as provided in the
special conditions in this sideletter.
3. These special conditions shall not apply to any post-production work on the
productions covered hereunder, and all post-production and lab work shall be
performed in accordance with the IATSE Basic Agreement of 2021 and the West
Coast Studio Local Agreements.
4. The roster provisions of the IATSE Basic Agreement and the West Coast Local
Agreements are fully applicable; however, prospective employees are free to
accept or refuse a call to work on any production covered hereunder and any
refusal to accept a call will not count as a refusal under the roster provisions of
Paragraph 68 of the applicable Local Agreements.
5. The special conditions applicable to the productions covered hereunder are:
(i) (A) Notwithstanding any wage rate changes made in the future in the
Basic Agreement and the West Coast Local Agreements, wages are
as listed on the attached "Made for Television Long-Form
Agreement Rate Schedules."
(B) It is the good faith intention of Producer that an employee (other
than an employee engaged as Local 44 "Construction Labor" or
Local 729 "Set Painter") who works in a pay classification for
which a weekly wage rate has not been specified in the applicable
Local Agreement (e.g., Production Painter in Local 729, Grip in

Local 80, and Lamp Operator and Lighting Technician in Local
#728) and who is employed and paid at the weekly wage rate is
being engaged to perform the required work within the
classification for all the time that particular work is needed on the
project (e.g., Producer expects at the time of hiring to utilize a grip
for all three (3) weeks on which grip work is needed during a four
(4) week shoot). Otherwise, the applicable hourly or daily rate
shall be paid for these classifications. This shall not be construed
to be a run-of-the-show guarantee.
However, an employee in the "Construction Labor" and "Set
Painter" craft and classifications on pre-production, for which the
Local Agreement does not provide for a weekly salary, shall be
hired only as a daily employee.
Any allegation of improper application of the above shall be
promptly reviewed by representatives of the affected Local(s), the
IATSE International Office and the Labor Relations Department of
Producer before filing any grievances on the matter.
(ii) Staffing will be fully interchangeable with the following crew:
- Art Director (1) - Sound (¶106 of the Local 695
- Camera (4) Agreement is applicable)
- Set Construction as needed - Greensperson
- Grip Operations (4) - Electrical Operations (4)
- Craft Services (1) - Special Effects as needed
- Production Painter as needed - Set Dressing (3)
- First Aid as needed - Props (2)
- Make-up and Hair Stylist - Wardrobe (2)
(1 each) - Script Supervisor (1)
- Set Designer as needed
(iii) Overtime will be paid at the rate of time and one-half after eight (8) hours
worked, except that daily overtime for Script Supervisors shall be paid as
provided in the Local 871 Agreement (i.e., time and one-half after six (6)
hours); double time, when applicable, to be paid after fourteen (14)
elapsed hours. Overtime pay for weekly employees shall be based on one-
fortieth (1/40) of the weekly rate.

(iv) Meal periods - The time for breaking for the meal period may be extended
by up to one-half hour beyond the time specified in the Local Agreements
without penalty at the request of the Director. Notice for such a delayed
break must be given no later than one (1) hour before the meal period and
the extension may not be scheduled.
(v) Producer will not be required to pay the percentage of salaries for the
specified contractual holidays; however, any employee working on such
holiday will be paid double time. Weekly employees will be paid for any
holiday not worked during their period of employment.
(vi) Producer will not be required to pay the percentage of salaries as vacation
pay.
(vii) Producer will not be required to pay any transportation allowance, such as
specified in Paragraphs 21(c) and 22(b)(2) of the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements.
(viii) An employee hired as a weekly employee shall be paid a full week's pay.
Producer will not prorate the weekly rate for the purpose of paying the
employee on a daily rate or fractional weekly basis, unless the employee
elects not to perform the full week's work (e.g., the employee, hired for a
week, works three days and quits).
6. Prior to actual employment, Producer shall inform and provide written
information to each employee to be hired of the special conditions applicable to
the production.
7. Producer will provide to the appropriate West Coast Studio Locals the name of
the project and, upon request, the names and classifications of the employees who
will be employed under the special conditions of this Sideletter.
8. The following additional special terms and conditions shall apply only to two (2)
hour pilots for which there is no series commitment at the time the pilot is ordered
and which are produced under the terms of this Sideletter.
(i) Producer agrees to produce all future episodes resulting from the two (2)
hour production under the episodic television provisions of the IATSE
Basic Agreement in Los Angeles County or immediate areas, provided
that when the series is required to be produced outside Los Angeles
County or immediate areas due to creative reasons only, employment of a
majority of the crew from Los Angeles County (or if the episodes are
made in one of the "IATSE production cities") will satisfy this condition.

Matthew D. Loeb

As of August 1, 2021

(ii) When the series is based in Los Angeles County, the Producer may do
location work outside of Los Angeles County on isolated episodes and
employ portions of the crew from Los Angeles County without the
number constituting a majority of the crew from Los Angeles County.
(iii) If principal photography of the first episode commences within seventy
(70) days of completion of principal photography of the two (2) hour long-
form television production, the Producer shall retroactively pay to the
IATSE-represented employees who worked on the two-hour television
production the wages set forth in the episodic television provisions of the
Basic Agreement.
(iv) The AMPTP and the IATSE shall appoint a joint committee to review and
monitor any issues relating to the above.
9. The following additional special terms and conditions shall apply only to long-
form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which are budgeted
at $9,000,000 or less and which the Producer has elected to cover under the terms
of this Sideletter, rather than under the terms of the Low Budget Theatrical
Agreement:
(i) The IATSE shall have the right to audit any such production to ensure that
its budget falls within the aforementioned limitation. If the budget cap is
exceeded, the wages, terms and conditions of the Basic Agreement shall
apply.
(ii) "Behind-the-scenes" shots, when done by the signatory company for such
productions, shall also be covered under the terms of this sideletter.

The IATSE agrees to meet and negotiate on aproduction-by-production basis with respectto
newone-hourepisodic television series forwhich the pattern budget does not exceed $1,300,000
in direct costs ofproduction per episode. This approach will allowthe parties to tailorthe
agreement to the specific needs ofthe production and, thus, is more likely to achieve the goal of
encouraging lowbudget one-hour series production to be done in Los Angeles.

Re: Productions Made for New Media
Dear Matt:
This Sideletter to the Producer – IATSE Basic Agreement of 20211 confirms the understanding

of itself and its West Coast Studio Local Unions, on the one hand, and the Alliance of Motion

for a successor agreement to the 2018 Producer – IATSE Basic Agreement (hereinafter

collectively referred to as “New Media”).3 With respect to such productions intended for initial
use in new media, the parties agree as follows:
1 For convenience only, and without intending to change the meaning or effect of or alter the
interpretation of this Sideletter to the Basic Agreement, the parties agree to reprint this Sideletter in the

employees employed in the job classifications covered by the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements (hereinafter “the West Coast Studio Local Agreements”) within the geographic
scope of the applicable West Coast Studio Local Agreement on entertainment motion pictures of
the type traditionally covered under the Basic Agreement, other than those covered under the
Videotape Agreement, which are intended for initial exhibition in New Media, but excluding
news, sports, documentaries and “Experimental New Media Productions,” as that term is defined
below.
B. Coverage

geographic scope of, an industry-wide collective bargaining agreement which meets the
description in the first sentence of the second paragraph of this Paragraph B., and such
employees meet the description in either the second or third sentence of the second paragraph of

F. Reuse of New Media Programs (Other than a “High Budget SVOD Program”)
Only those covered New Media Productions (other than High Budget SVOD Programs)
on which two (2) or more “employees employed by the Producer under the Basic Agreement,” as
that term is used in Article XIX(a) and in Article XXVIII(a)(2) of the Basic Agreement,9 shall
generate residual payments and then only in accordance with the following:
(1) Reuse in New Media
(a) The Producer shall have the right to use an Original New Media
Production budgeted at $25,000 or less per minute (using the same cost elements as described in
the third paragraph of Paragraph B. above) on any new media platform without limitation as to
time, and without payment of residuals.
(b) The Producer shall have the right to use an Original New Media
Production budgeted at more than $25,000 per minute (using the same cost elements as described
in the third paragraph of Paragraph B. above) or a Derivative New Media Production without the
payment of residuals under the following circumstances:
(i) When such New Media Production is used on any free-to-the-
consumer, advertiser-supported platform; and
(ii) When such New Media Production is first released on a consumer
pay platform (i.e., download-to-rent, download-to-own or paid streaming), even if it is
subsequently released on a free-to-the-consumer advertiser-supported platform.
(c) If an Original New Media Production budgeted at more than $25,000 per
minute (using the same cost elements as described in the third paragraph of Paragraph B. above)
or a Derivative New Media Production is initially released on a free-to-the-consumer, advertiser-
supported platform and is subsequently released on consumer pay platforms (i.e., download-to-
own, download to rent or paid streaming), then Producer shall have a twenty-six (26) consecutive
week period of use on consumer pay platforms, commencing with the first day of use on
consumer pay platforms, without the payment of residuals. If the Producer uses the New Media
Production on consumer pay platforms beyond such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period,
then Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health Plans 5.4% of
“Producer’s gross,” as that term is defined in Paragraph 3 of the “Sideletter re Exhibition of
Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media,” attributable to use on consumer pay platforms
beyond the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period.
9 It is understood and agreed that any employee employed under the terms of the corresponding
"Productions Made for New Media" Sideletter in either the Local #52 Agreement or in the Local #161
Agreement shall not be considered an "employee employed by Producer under the Basic Agreement" for
purposes of Paragraph F. of this Sideletter.

Page 12
(d) If an Original New Media Production budgeted at more than $25,000 per
minute (using the same cost elements as described in the third paragraph of Paragraph B. above)
or a Derivative New Media Production is initially released simultaneously on free-to-the-
consumer, advertiser-supported platforms and to consumer pay platforms (i.e., download-to-own,
download-to-rent or paid streaming), then Producer shall have a twenty-six (26) consecutive
week period of use on consumer pay platforms, commencing with the first day of use on
consumer pay platforms, without the payment of residuals. If the Producer uses the New Media
Production on consumer pay platforms beyond such twenty-six (26) consecutive week period,
then Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health Plans 5.4% of the
“Producer’s gross,” as that term is defined in Paragraph 3 of the “Sideletter re Exhibition of
Motion Pictures Transmitted via New Media,” realized from any subsequent license which
includes use on consumer pay platforms, which “gross” is attributable to use on consumer pay
platforms beyond the twenty-six (26) consecutive week period, measured from the first day of
use on consumer pay platforms under the first license.
(2) Reuse in Traditional Media
The applicable provisions of Article XXVIII with respect to exhibition on “pay
television,” as that term is defined in Article XXVIII(a)(3)(ii) of the Basic Agreement, shall
apply when a covered New Media Production is exhibited on pay television. The applicable
provisions of Article XXVIII with respect to exhibition on “cassettes,” as that term is defined in
Article XXVIII(a)(3)(i), shall apply when a covered New Media Production is exhibited on
videocassettes or DVDs.
(3) General
It is understood that the tests for triggering Post ‘60s and Supplemental Markets
payments set forth in Article XIX and XXVIII of the Basic Agreement, including the
understandings set forth in subparagraph (g) of those Articles, and the proration provisions in
those Articles, shall also apply to residual payments due under the terms of this Sideletter.
Residual payments due under this Sideletter shall be prorated in the same manner as are
Supplemental Market monies under Article XXVIII of the Basic Agreement.

10 During the 2021 negotiations, the parties agreed as a matter of housekeeping to rename “grandfathered”

11 If the licensee orders additional High Budget SVOD Programs or episodes of a High Budget SVOD
series, the principal photography of which will commence on or after August 1, 2021, pursuant to a
license agreement entered into prior to August 1, 2018, and the Producer has the right to negotiate with
respect to the material terms and conditions of the license for the additional programs or episodes, then
the High Budget SVOD Program or episodes of the High Budget SVOD series shall be subject to the
terms of the Sideletter re Productions Made for New Media to the 2021 Basic Agreement. In the event
that Producer asserts that a High Budget SVOD Program is grandfathered under the provisions of the
second paragraph of Paragraph G.(1) above, a limited number of representatives of the IATSE, subject to
the execution of a confidentiality agreement satisfactory in form to Producer, may inspect those portions
of the license agreement that are relevant to determine whether the Producer had the right to renegotiate
with respect to the material terms and conditions of the license for the additional programs or episodes.
All information received or reviewed by representatives of the IATSE shall be kept confidential, and
neither the IATSE nor its representatives shall disclose any such information, except as necessary to

(B) intended primarily for use on a subscription consumer pay
video-on-demand new media service;
(C) subject to a license agreement with an SVOD service with
more than 1,000,000 domestic subscribers, which license agreement was entered into on or after
January 1, 2019 (or, in the absence of a license agreement, the principal photography of which
commences on or after January 1, 2019); and
(D) produced with employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement, as defined in Article XXVIII.(c)(1)(iii) of this Agreement and as further clarified in
subparagraph (g) of Article XXVIII. of this Agreement.
(ii) If such Program is released in theaters in the United States or
Canada and an admission fee is charged to view the Program,37 Producer shall make a payment
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan38 in the amount of:
(A) five and four-tenths percent (5.4%) of the straight time
scale earnings of all employees employed on the live action High Budget SVOD Program under
the Basic Agreement; or
(B) three and six-tenths percent (3.6%) of the straight time

the Basic Agreement.
Such payment shall be due in equal installments over eight (8)
consecutive calendar quarters commencing sixty (60) calendar days following the close of the

the foregoing amounts covers all theatrical exhibitions of the Program in perpetuity.
its representatives or retained professionals shall disclose any such information except as necessary to
enforce their rights under the Agreement.
37 It is understood that when the Program is exhibited at a film festival or charitable event, no payment
shall be due hereunder if (a) an admission fee is charged only for the festival or the event (but not for the
Program itself) or (b) an admission fee is charged for the Program. In addition, the IATSE shall not
unreasonably deny waivers of this provision for exhibition at an educational institution or similar
circumstances.
38 The bargaining parties agree that this payment shall not reduce the minimum funding otherwise
required for the Pension Plan (in other words, when determining whether the minimum funding
requirement of the Pension Plan has been met, no reduction shall be made in the amount of Supplemental
Markets monies that would otherwise be allocated to the Pension Plan by reason of amounts payable
under this provision).

It is understood that a theatrical motion picture that is exhibited on
a subscription video-on-demand consumer pay new media platform is not subject to the
foregoing residual; instead, the Sideletter re Exhibition of Traditional Motion Pictures Via New
Media applies.
(iii) This Paragraph G.(5)(f) shall expire upon termination of the 2021
IATSE Basic Agreement.
(6) The number of subscribers in the United States and Canada shall be determined as
of July 1st of each year of the Agreement. For a High Budget SVOD series, the number of
subscribers that applies to the first episode of the season shall apply to the entire season in
perpetuity.
H. Representatives of the IATSE shall have the right to review the budget of a covered new
media production solely for the purpose of determining whether the covered new media
production falls within the definition of a Mid-Budget SVOD Program as set forth in Paragraph
D.(3) above or a High Budget SVOD Program as set forth in Paragraph G. above, and, if so,
whether the production meets the budget break in Tier 1 or Tier 2 as set forth in Paragraph G.(3)
above. Producer agrees to cooperate and provide requested relevant additional information about
the budget that is reasonably available to it. All information received or reviewed by
representatives of the IATSE shall be kept confidential, and neither the IATSE nor its
representatives shall disclose any such information, except as necessary to enforce its rights
under this Agreement.
I. “Sunset” Clause
The parties recognize that these provisions are being negotiated at a time when the
business models and patterns of usage of productions in New Media are in the process of
exploration, experimentation and innovation. Therefore, except as provided in the next
paragraph, the provisions of this Sideletter shall expire on the termination date of the Basic
Agreement and will be of no force and effect thereafter. No later than sixty (60) days before that
expiration date, the parties will meet to negotiate new terms and conditions for reuse of
productions made for New Media.
The terms and conditions herein applicable to High Budget SVOD Programs, other than
the provisions of Paragraph G.(5)(f) herein, shall apply and remain in full force and effect, and
without change, to High Budget SVOD Programs produced by the Producer hereunder,
regardless of the terms or provisions of any agreement which is a modification, extension or
