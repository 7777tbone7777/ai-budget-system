Artificial Intelligence
a.

Add a new Article 20 to the 2024 Local 52 Majors Agreement as follows:
“ARTICLE 20. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
“This Article 20 applies prospectively on or after [insert the date that is
October 1, 2024 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the
AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later].
“(a)

Definitions

“The parties acknowledge that ‘Artificial Intelligence’ and ‘AI’
have become catchall names that generally refer to the ability of a machine-based
system to apply analysis and logic-based techniques to solve problems or perform
tasks and improve as it analyzes more data. An ‘AI System’ is any machinebased system that uses AI as a core function.
“(1) Machine Learning. The parties acknowledge that machine
learning (‘ML’) is a subset of AI that enables machines to develop algorithms,
including via deep learning (as defined below), based on statistical inferences
drawn from patterns in submitted training data, including, but not limited to,
diffusion models and large language models, for the purpose of performing tasks.
Such tasks include, but are not limited to, predicting human behaviors,
disseminating information and generating content.
“(2) Generative Artificial Intelligence. The parties acknowledge
that generative artificial intelligence (‘Gen AI’) refers to a subset of ML that
generates new content including, but not limited to, text, video, audio, three00322037.DOCX; 8

32

dimensional (3D) models, code, and images. A ‘Gen AI System’ is any machinebased system that uses Gen AI as a core function.
“(3) Deep Learning. The parties acknowledge that deep learning
refers to a subset of ML based on artificial neural networks that have multiple
layers of connected artificial neuron nodes processing data.
“(4) The terms ‘Gen AI’ and ‘Deep Learning’ are used for
convenience and this provision shall also apply to any technology that is
consistent with the foregoing definitions, regardless of its name or designation.
“(b)

Existing Technologies and Practices

“The parties acknowledge that the Employers have historically
used digital technologies, including without limitation so-called ‘traditional AI’
technologies programmed to perform specific functions (e.g., CGI, VFX, sound
effects), and technologies such as those used during any stage of previsualization, pre-production, production, post-production, marketing and
distribution and may continue to do so, consistent with their historical practices.
“(c)

New Technologies and Practices

“(1) The parties acknowledge the importance of human
contributions in motion pictures and the need to address the potential impact of
the use of AI Systems on employment under this Agreement and the Local 52
Supplemental Digital Production Agreement (collectively, the ‘Agreements’).
“(2)

Use of New Technologies

“(i)
An Employer continues to have the right to utilize
new technologies in connection with motion picture production, including in
connection with creative elements. Employer may require employees to use any
AI System4 or resulting output of such systems for use in connection with the
performance of covered work. Employees who are assigned to utilize an AI
System to perform services, including by inputting prompts or otherwise
overseeing the use of the AI System, shall continue to be covered under the terms
of this Agreement while performing such work.
“(ii) The Employer will not require an employee to
provide prompts furnished by the employee in the performance of bargaining unit
work in a manner that results in the displacement of any covered employee.
4

Should the Employer agree to use an employee’s own AI System, Employer and employee shall negotiate for
reasonable reimbursement for such use.

00322037.DOCX; 8

33

“(iii) Should an employee use AI Systems in the
performance of covered work, the employee will be required to adhere to the
Employer’s policies (e.g., policies related to ethics, privacy, security,
copyrightability or other protection of intellectual property rights), which shall be
provided to the employee. In any event, the Employer retains the right to require
that an employee obtain consent from the Employer before using AI Systems,
and Employer retains the right to reject the use of AI Systems or any output from
such use, including when the use could adversely affect the copyrightability or
exploitation of the work or create other risks or liabilities for the Employer.
Employer agrees to provide the International Union with any written policies
governing the use of AI Systems by employees covered under this Agreement.
Upon request, the Employer shall also provide Local 52 with any such written
policies.
“An Employer’s decision to require an employee to
use an AI System in connection with the employee’s performance of bargaining
unit work, including for any creative elements or administrative tasks, will be
subject to consultation with the employee at the employee’s request, provided
that the requirements of production allow time for the consultation.
“(iv) The Employer shall indemnify the employee from
liability and necessary costs, including by providing the employee a legal defense
resulting from any claims arising from the use of AI Systems or the resulting
output occurring in the performance of the employee’s duties and within the
scope of the employee’s employment with Employer, subject to the conditions
that:
“(A) This subparagraph (iv) shall not apply in
any instance in which the injury, loss or damage is the result of or caused by, in
whole or in part, the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such employee;
“(B) Employee is not in breach of the
Employer’s policies which have been disclosed to the employee and the
employee has made appropriate disclosure of the use of AI Systems to the
Employer;
“(C) Immediately upon the employee and/or the
Union being informed of any claim or litigation, the employee and/or the Union
shall notify Employer thereof and give Employer full details of any claim or the
institution of any action for which the employee seeks indemnification under this
subparagraph, including by delivering to the Employer every demand, notice,
summons, complaint or other process received;

00322037.DOCX; 8

34

“(D) Employer shall name or cover the employee
as an additional insured on its errors and omissions policies, if any, respecting
motion pictures; and
“(E) The employee shall cooperate fully in the
defense of any claim for which indemnification is provided in this subparagraph
(iv), including the attending of hearings and trials, securing and giving evidence
and obtaining the attendance of witnesses.
“(d)

Implementation of Work Training Programs

“The parties acknowledge that the preferred method of addressing
impact resulting from new technologies is through provision of work training and
other programs designed to foster new skills to improve opportunities for
employment and effective use of AI tools. The parties agree to cooperate in the
establishment of work training and other programs with respect to covered work
under this Agreement. A committee will be convened for the purpose of
formulating and implementing such training and other programs. The training
and other programs shall be designed in cooperation between the parties and shall
be focused on training employees in (A) skills required to operate AI Systems
associated with the employee’s current work classification and/or (B) new skills
required to transition to other classifications of work covered by this Agreement.
The parties agree that the committee shall meet within ninety (90) days of
contract ratification.
“(e)

Ongoing Obligations

“(1) Joint Industry-Wide Meetings. The parties agree to meet at
least semi-annually during the term of this Agreement at the request of the
International Union to discuss and review information related to the Employers’
use and intended use of AI Systems in the production of motion pictures covered
under this Agreement, to the extent that such information has been made publicly
available. Topics for the meeting shall be identified in advance.
“(2) Each Employer agrees to meet quarterly with the
International Union, on a company-by-company basis, during the term of this
Agreement, at the request of the International Union. At such meeting, Employer
will identify any significant emerging technologies utilizing AI Systems that the
Employer is using or intends to use in motion picture production which may
affect persons covered by this Agreement. Because Employer’s current and
future technology may be discussed during these meetings, and in order to protect
Employer’s proprietary and/or confidential information, trade secrets and
intellectual property, the International Union agrees that its representatives
participating in these meetings will be limited to a reasonable number of
individuals (i.e., not to exceed eight [8]) representing bargaining units for which
00322037.DOCX; 8

35

the topics identified in advance to be discussed are relevant, and each
participating representative will execute a mutually agreed-upon Confidentiality
Agreement.
“(3) Topics for discussion at the meetings described in
subparagraphs (1) and (2) above may, in addition to other topics related to AI
Systems as proposed in advance of the meeting, include:

b.

Add a Sideletter re: “Artificial Intelligence” to the 2024 Local 52 Majors
Agreement to provide as follows:
“During the 2024 negotiations, the parties reached agreement to add a new Article
20 to the Local 52 Feature and Television Production Contract to address the
Employer’s right to use new technologies, including artificial intelligence and AI
Systems (as those terms are defined therein), in connection with motion picture
production. Article 20 was the result of extensive discussions between the parties,
including with their respective experts, and calls for regular meetings between the
Employers and the International Union during the term to keep the Union advised
and informed of developments in the use of AI Systems affecting bargaining unit
members. The parties acknowledge both the Employer’s right to use new
technologies involving AI System(s) in Article 20 and the Employer’s obligation,
upon request of the Union, to negotiate over any impact of such use on bargaining
unit employees as required by law.
“Under the Local 52 Feature and Television Production Contract, Employers may
have additional obligations, and other dispute resolution provisions may apply,
under Article 7 (‘Technological Change’) as the result of the introduction of an AI
System. Should that be the case, that Article, including the protections provided
therein, this Sideletter and Article 20 shall apply to employees working under the
Local 52 Feature and Television Production Contract.
“The parties confirm that an Employer may experiment with using an AI System
for the primary purpose of determining, under operating conditions, the feasibility
and/or adequacy of performance of any AI System and may test the AI System
under operating conditions by persons under the jurisdiction of the Local 52
Feature and Television Production Contract on a temporary basis. Those
circumstances do not constitute a technological change or otherwise impose any
obligation on Employer, other than those specifically set forth in Article 20 to the
Local 52 Feature and Television Production Contract.”

18.

Bereavement Leave
Add a new Article to the 2024 Local 52 Majors Agreement, effective October 1, 2024 or
the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of
ratification, whichever is later, as follows:
“In the event of the death of a ‘family member’* of a regularly-scheduled employee, the
employee shall be allowed up to three (3) days of paid bereavement leave. For
employees employed on an hourly or daily basis, a day of bereavement leave pay shall be
equal to eight (8) hours' pay at the employee's straight time hourly rate. For weekly
employees (including ‘on call’ employees, if any), a day of bereavement leave pay shall
be equal to one-fifth (1/5th) of the employee's weekly rate.

00322037.DOCX; 8

37

“An employee who is absent from work due to bereavement leave will be reinstated to
the employee’s original position on the production upon return, provided that the position
continues to exist; however, for continuity purposes, an Employer is not required to
reinstate an employee on an episodic series until work on the current episode has been
completed. The Employer and the Union will discuss on a case-by-case basis, upon the
request of the Employer, issues related to the individual’s reinstatement.
“* ‘Family member’ means any of the following: (1) a biological, adopted or foster child,
stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis; (2) a
biological, adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or the
employee's spouse or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis
when the employee was a minor child; (3) a spouse; (4) a registered domestic partner; (5)
a grandparent; (6) a grandchild; or (7) a sibling.”
19.

Bulletins
a.

12-Minute Meal Grace
Employers agree to issue the following bulletin to appropriate production
personnel:
“During the 2024 negotiations for the Local 52 Majors Agreement and
Supplemental Digital Production Agreement, the Union raised concerns that
Employers use the twelve (12) minute grace period to delay meal periods beyond
six (6) hours from call or the last meal period (without payment of meal penalties)
on a daily or planned basis.
“This bulletin is a reminder that under the Local 52 Majors Agreement and
Supplemental Digital Production Agreement, the twelve (12) minute grace period
‘shall not be scheduled nor automatic nor is it intended for everyday use.’ Please
be sure that production personnel are aware of this restriction on the use of the
twelve (12) minute grace period.”

b.

Climate Control
Employers agree to issue the following bulletin to the appropriate production
personnel:
“During the 2024 negotiations for the Local 52 Majors Agreement and
Supplemental Digital Production Agreement, the Union discussed that employees,
both on and off production, work under varied conditions, including a wide range
of temperatures. The Union raised concerns regarding on and off production
employees’ receipt of accommodations for heating (when working in a cold
environment) and cooling (when working in a hot environment).

00322037.DOCX; 8

38

“Accordingly, this bulletin serves as a reminder that Employers should endeavor
to provide those accommodations, which may include air conditioning or heating,
fans, shade or heating tents and similar accommodations, when the temperature
calls for those arrangements to be made. It is understood that the exact nature of
the accommodations may vary depending on the circumstances, such as
availability in the location where the work is taking place. It is also worth noting
that open stage doors adversely affect the efficiency of heating and cooling
systems, and efforts should be made to minimize the amount of time that stage
doors are left open.”
c.

Restrooms and Menstrual Products
Employers agree to issue the following bulletin to appropriate production
personnel:
“During the negotiations for the 2024 Local 52 Majors Agreement and
Supplemental Digital Production Agreement, the Union raised concerns about the
provision of adequate restroom facilities for employees. Please remind
production personnel responsible for setting up restroom facilities that they should
ensure that an adequate number of restroom facilities are provided and are cleaned
on a regular schedule. Furthermore, productions should make reasonable efforts
to provide a gender neutral bathroom, which may include relabeling a single
occupancy bathroom to be gender neutral.
“In addition, the Union requested, and the parties agreed, that Employers
will make best efforts to provide menstrual products, including tampons and
menstrual pads, at no cost to the employee.
“Please ensure that a copy of this bulletin is distributed to the appropriate
personnel in your production offices.”

the Employer must provide a hard copy of the start package/forms to the employee or
assist with completion of the electronic start package/forms.”

22.

Sick Leave
Modify Article 17(b) of the Local 52 Majors Agreement as follows:
“ARTICLE 17.

SICK LEAVE
***

“(b) Paid Sick Leave Outside of the State of New York: The following is
applicable to employees working under this Agreement outside the State of New York:
“(1) Accrual. Commencing June 1, 2022, eligible Eligible employees
covered by this Agreement shall accrue one (1) hour of paid sick leave for every thirty
(30) hours worked for the Employer, up to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours or six (6)
days (up to a maximum of eighty (80) hours or ten (10) days, effective [insert date
that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the
AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]). (In lieu of the foregoing
hourly accrual of paid sick leave, and provided that advance notice is given to the
employee, an Employer may elect to provide employees, upon their eligibility to use sick
leave as provided below (i.e., upon working thirty (30) days for the Employer and after
their ninetieth (90th) day of employment (forty-fifth day, effective [insert date that is
January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP
receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]) with the Employer (based on days
00322037.DOCX; 8

worked or guaranteed)), with a bank of twenty-four (24) hours or three (3) days of sick
leave per year (forty (40) hours or five (5) days of sick leave per year, effective [insert
date that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which
the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]), such year to be
measured, as designated by the Employer, as either a calendar year or starting from the
employee’s anniversary date. Under this elected option, such banked sick leave days
may not be carried over to the following year.)
“(2) To be eligible to accrue paid sick leave, the employee must have
worked for the Employer for at least thirty (30) days within a one (1) year period, such
year to be measured, as designated by the Employer, as either a calendar year or starting
from the employee’s anniversary date. Sick leave may be used in minimum increments
of four (4) hours upon oral or written request after the eligible employee has been
employed by the Employer for ninety (90) days (forty-five (45) days, effective [insert
date that is January 1, 2025 or the first Sunday following the business day on which
the AMPTP receives notice of ratification, whichever is later]) (based on days worked
or guaranteed), such period to be measured, as designated by the Employer, as either a
calendar year or starting from the employee’s anniversary date. Reasonable advance
notification of the need for sick leave is required if the use is foreseeable; otherwise,
notice is required as soon as practicable. Sick days accrued on an hourly basis shall carry
over to the following year of employment; however, the Employer may limit the use of
such accrued time to no more than twenty-four (24) hours or three (3) days (no more
than forty (40) hours or five (5) days, effective [insert date that is January 1, 2025 or
the first Sunday following the business day on which the AMPTP receives notice of
ratification, whichever is later]) during each year of employment as defined by the
Employer in advance. To the extent the employee is eligible for paid sick leave in a
jurisdiction with a law that has not been waived in this Agreement, any sick leave paid
pursuant to the law shall count towards satisfying the Employer’s obligations to provide
paid sick leave under this Article 17(b).
***
