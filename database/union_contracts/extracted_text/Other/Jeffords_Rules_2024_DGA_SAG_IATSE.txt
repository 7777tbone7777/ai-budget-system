SAFETY AWARENESS CONSIDERATIONS / RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES – UNIONS AND GUILDS
SAFETY AWARENESS CONSIDERATIONS
An awareness of accidents on the set in recent years reminds us that safety is a primary
concern.
Employers, who are ultimately responsible for safety on a show, have often assigned
safety responsibility to DGA members.
Safety starts in Prep, with awareness of safety bulletins and planning of stunts, special
effects, and challenging scenes. This requires careful consideration of potentially dangerous
or unsafe conditions, difficult or environmentally suspect locations, inclement or extreme
weather, or anticipated long shooting hours.
Be aware of current conditions in your area, and plan for health and safety considerations.
Check with your Studio, network, production company and Guilds and union locals for
individual required procedures and guidelines.
Many companies have successfully produced features and television under self-imposed
limits of a 12-hour maximum shooting day. When a 12-hour shooting day is not practical, and
long or late hours are needed to complete the work, Employers are now required under most
circumstances to offer transportation or overnight housing for the safety of the cast and crew.
Copies of Safety Bulletins are available through CSATF.org, the DGA Website, DGA
office, AMPTP, Production companies, or Guild and Union offices.
Revised California laws establish criminal liability for certain individuals responsible
for safety on the set. Any person, who is responsible for a danger and does nothing to
remove it or give warning, is subject to a charge of criminal negligence.
Any member of the ‘Director’s Team’ should stop a shot for reasons of imminent danger.
Safety takes precedence over expediency.
No film is worth the loss of an arm, a leg or a life. Please keep safety a primary concern.
Basic Safety Standards in the Workplace
(L600 Majors Article 61)
“No Producer [Employer] shall require or permit any employee to go into or be in any
employment or place of employment which is not safe and healthful... every Producer and
every employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules,
regulations… no person (Producer or employee) shall remove, displace, damage, destroy
or carry off any safety device, safeguard, notice or warning; [nor] interfere with the use of
any method or process adopted for the protection of any employee… “
“Call sheets shall identify the name and phone number of the Producer’s safety contact,
which may be an individual or a department, as well as the phone number for the
Producer’s safety hotline.”
SAFETY RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES – UNIONS AND GUILDS
IATSE
COURTESY HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION
(2021 IATSE BA & Sideletters)
“Upon request of an employee who is required to work in excess of fourteen (14) hours
and who advises the Employer that he/she is too tired to drive home safely, Employer
shall provide the employee either courtesy housing or round trip transportation from
the designated crew parking area to home and return at the Employer’s expense. The
Employer shall have no responsibility for the personal vehicle of an employee who elected
to use his/her personal vehicle in lieu of Employer-provided transportation.”

SAFETY RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES – UNIONS AND GUILDS
DGA
BASIC AGREEMENT SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES (Exhibit 2, 2020 MOA with AMPTP)
The Employer is responsible for ensuring a safe working environment. To facilitate this,
the Employer shall have a Safety Program that defines the safety responsibilities of, and
authority granted to, Employees working under this Agreement. Employers operating in
California may satisfy this requirement by developing and maintaining an effective Injury
and Illness Prevention Program (“IIPP”) in compliance with state law, which shall include
a statement of roles and responsibilities substantially similar to those set forth below.
Employers operating outside California may satisfy this requirement by adhering to the
division of roles and responsibilities set forth below and are encouraged to model their
Safety Program on the requirements of an IIPP as provided under California law.
All Employees are required to understand and adhere to the Employer’s Safety Program
and their duties under it and to report safety concerns in good faith. No Employee shall
be discharged or otherwise disciplined for refusing in good faith to work on a job that
exposes him or her to a clear and present danger to life or limb, or for making a good
faith report to the Employer, his or her supervisor or the Employer’s Production Safety
Department (if any) relating to the safety of another employee or bystander exposed to a
clear and present danger to life or limb. It is the shared commitment of the AMPTP and
DGA to vigorously protect all employees from retaliation for exercising this responsibility.
EMPLOYER
The Employer is responsible for ensuring that health and safety are taken fully into
account when the production is budgeted and that proper resources for the management
of health and safety and the fulfillment of the Safety Program are provided. Practical day-
to-day responsibility for ensuring that the Safety Program is properly implemented may
be delegated to the Unit Production Manager (or other designee); however, the Employer
always has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring a safe working environment and shall
support the Unit Production Manager (or other individual designated by the Employer) in
the implementation and administration of the Safety Program. To that end, the Employer
shall designate and identify to the Unit Production Manager an individual (e.g., a line
producer or production executive) to serve as a point of contact in the event the Unit
Production Manager requires additional support and/or resources on safety issues for
a given production. If the Employer has a Production Safety Department, it shall also
identify an employee of the Production Safety Department to serve as a resource on
safety matters for a given production.
DIRECTOR
The Director shall promote the importance of a safe working environment for the
production, including by supporting the Unit Production Manager in the implementation
and administration of the Safety Program and supporting the First Assistant Director
in maintaining a safe set. The Director is responsible for considering the health and
safety implications of directorial decisions. In carrying out his or her directorial duties,
the Director shall obtain guidance on safety matters from the Unit Production Manager,
the First Assistant Director, department heads, supervisors, or other individuals with
relevant safety expertise, as applicable, and may rely upon their advice. The Director is
encouraged to ask questions about any safety-related matter.
The Jeffords Rules. 1/31/2024 33

--- PAGE 36 of 62 ---

SAFETY RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES – UNIONS AND GUILDS
UNIT PRODUCTION MANAGER
The Unit Production Manager has primary responsibility for the effective implementation
and administration of the Safety Program for a given production with respect to all phases
of production (i.e., beginning with pre-production and continuing through post-production)
during his or her period of employment. The First Assistant Director and all department
heads and supervisors shall report to the Unit Production Manager on safety issues, and
the Unit Production Manager is responsible for ensuring that these individuals meet their
responsibilities as set forth in the Safety Program.
The Unit Production Manager may also delegate specific safety responsibilities as
appropriate. In carrying out his or her safety responsibilities, the Unit Production Manager
shall obtain guidance on safety matters from the First Assistant Director, department
heads, supervisors, or other individuals with relevant safety expertise, as applicable, and
may rely upon their advice. The Unit Production Manager has the authority to halt any
production activity that poses a risk to cast or crew members’ health or safety and shall
not be discharged or otherwise disciplined for exercising this authority in good faith.
FIRST ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
The First Assistant Director reports to the Unit Production Manager on safety issues and
is responsible for implementing and administering the Safety Program with respect to the
cast and crew on set (whether on stage or on location), which may include during tech
scouts, prep, camera tests, screen tests, rehearsals and filming. By way of example, cast
and crew members may always approach the Unit Production Manager with a safety
concern, but they should ordinarily report safety concerns that arise on set to the First
Assistant Director.
The First Assistant Director is responsible for coordinating on set safety, for conveying
safety requirements to all cast and crew members and supporting department heads and
supervisors in meeting their Safety Program responsibilities. In carrying out his or her
safety responsibilities, the First Assistant Director shall obtain guidance on safety matters
from department heads, supervisors, or other individuals with relevant safety expertise,
as applicable, and may rely upon their advice.
The First Assistant Director shall communicate with the Director, the Unit Production
Manager and the Production Safety Department (if any) regarding any health and safety
concerns that are identified prior to and during any production day. In addition, the First
Assistant Director shall ensure that proper control measures have been implemented
and communicated to all involved, including by conducting safety meetings and including
appropriate information on call sheets. The First Assistant Director has the authority to
halt any production activity that poses a risk to cast or crew members’ health or safety
and shall not be discharged or otherwise disciplined for exercising this authority in good
faith.
34 The Jeffords Rules. 1/31/2024

--- PAGE 37 of 62 ---

SAFETY RULES AND RESPONSIBILITIES – UNIONS AND GUILDS
SECOND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
The Second Assistant Director reports to the First Assistant Director on safety issues
and shall assist the First Assistant Director in implementing and administering the Safety
Program. For example, the Second Assistant Director shall assist the First Assistant
Director in coordinating on set safety, conveying safety requirements to all cast and crew
members and supporting department heads and supervisors in meeting their Safety
Program responsibilities.
The Second Assistant Director shall also assist the First Assistant Director in
communicating with the Unit Production Manager and the Production Safety Department
(if any) regarding any health and safety concerns and ensuring that proper control
measures have been implemented and communicated to all involved. Additional
responsibilities include maintaining documentation of safety meetings, crew notices
and accident reports; including appropriate information on call sheets; and preparing
accurate production reports.
When assigned to perform location managing duties in areas where such work is
performed by Employees employed under this Agreement, the Second Assistant Director
is also responsible for identifying production locations and bringing to the attention
of the Unit Production Manager, First Assistant Director, Construction Coordinator,
Transportation Coordinator, or any other applicable Department Head, and the Production
Safety Department (if any), any apparent safety hazards so they may be evaluated and
mitigated as appropriate.
PRODUCTION SAFETY DEPARTMENT
Employers are encouraged to establish a Production Safety Department as a resource

HARASSMENT / WORK ENVIRONMENT
HARASSMENT / WORK ENVIRONMENT
IATSE
“Satisfactory completion of the “A” safety training course and the harassment
prevention training course through CSATF is required for placement on the
Industry Experience Roster.”
SAG-AFTRA
Harassment Prevention Policy
Per the 2020 Memorandum of Agreement, “each producer is committed to maintaining
a working environment that is free from unlawfull harassment” and, once informed of a
complaint of a violation, “the Producer shall investigate promptly [and] upon conclusion
of the Producer’s investigation, the Producer will take action it deems appropriate and
warranted.”
Nudity and Sex Scenes
The 2023 Memorandum of Agreement contains modifications to provisions regarding
nudity and sex scenes.
Check the SAG-AFTRA “Quick Guide for Scenes Involving Nudity and Simulated
Sex,” studio policies, and performer’s contract for necessary considerations. Intimacy
Coordinators may be employed and consulted to the extent that they do not interfere
with Director’s rights.
DGA
Directors: “The DGA agrees... to work with the Employers to modify the existing CSATF
Harassment Prevention 2 (HP 2) course to incorporate Director-related concerns, [and]
agree that the Employers may require Directors to complete the existing CSATF online
prevention course, which is in further discussion.
Right to Representation - Weingarten Rights
You have the right to have a DGA representative present with you if your employer
is questioning you as part of an investigation where you reasonably believe that the
investigation may result in your employer disciplining you. Therefore, if you are ever
questioned by your employer under such circumstances, you should tell your employer
the following:
“If my responses to your questions could lead to my being disciplined or
terminated, or adversely affect my personal working conditions, I respectfully
request that you postpone meeting with me or asking questions until my union
representative can be present for that meeting or questioning.”
