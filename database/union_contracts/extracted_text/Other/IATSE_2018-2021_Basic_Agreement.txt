II. Union Security
(a) Producers severally agree that each and every employee
hired by the Producer to perform services in the County of Los Angeles,
or hired by the Producer in the County of Los Angeles to perform
services outside said County, in the crafts and classifications of work
described in Articles III and IV hereof, shall be and remain a member in
good standing of the IATSE and the appropriate West Coast Studio
Locals on and after the thirtieth day following the first day of
employment or the effective date of such respective agreements between
the Producers and the several unions, whichever is the later. The
foregoing requirements of union membership as a condition of
employment shall be subject to the obligations of the parties under the
law.
As defined and applied in this Article II, the term
"member of the Union in good standing" means a person who offers to
pay (and, if the Union accepts the offer, pays) Union initiation fees and
dues as financial obligations in accordance with the requirements of the
National Labor Relations Act.
(b) Within a reasonable time, but not to exceed three (3)
days after receipt of written notice from the IATSE and/or the Local
Union that any such then-employed employee is not a member as above
required, and that such employee has been so notified in writing prior to
such notice to Producer, the Producer shall discharge any such employee
who fails to remedy such default within said three (3) days after
Producer receives such notice. The Producer shall not be in default
unless it fails to act, if necessary, within said time after receipt of such
notice.
(c) Producers severally agree to inform the respective West
Coast Studio Locals, in writing, within seven (7) days (Saturdays,
Sundays and holidays excluded) from the date of employment hereafter
of any employee subject to this Agreement, of such employee's name,
residence address, Social Security number, and date of employment.
(d) The Producer agrees not to discriminate against any
IATSE member who may apply for a vacant position nor to discharge or
discriminate in any way against any employee because of such
membership.
(e) In case of repeal or amendment of the Labor
Management Relations Act of 1947 or in case of new legislation
rendering permissible any union security to the IATSE and/or its West
Coast Studio Locals greater than those specified in this Article II, then
- 7 -

substituted in lieu thereof. In such event, and if permissible under law,
the IATSE and its respective West Coast Studio Locals agree to supply
adequate, competent and qualified employees for the job requirements of
the Producers in the crafts and classifications covered by this
Agreement, and if the IATSE and/or the respective West Coast Studio
Locals fail to do so, the Producers may secure such employees from any
source.
III. Scope of Agreement
The crafts and classifications of work subject to this
Agreement are the crafts and classifications described in the Agreements
referred to in Article IV of this Agreement, and such other crafts and
classifications of work in which the Producers shall hereafter recognize

the collective bargaining agent of the employees in such crafts or
classifications, or in which the IATSE and/or a West Coast Studio Local
chartered by the IATSE shall be designated by the National Labor
Relations Board as the collective bargaining agent of such employees.
Upon such recognition or designation as aforesaid, this Agreement shall
immediately become effective and operative with respect to such
employees.
IV. Wage Scales, Hours of Employment and Working
Conditions

V. Bargaining Agency
All of the crafts and classifications of work set forth in the
Agreements referred to in Articles III and IV hereof constitute an
indivisible and integral bargaining unit of which the IATSE is and shall
be the exclusive collective bargaining representative.
The bargaining unit covered by this Agreement is a
single multi-employer unit consisting of the Employers who are parties
to this Agreement (including, among others, the signatory members of
the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (hereinafter
"the AMPTP")) and those Employers who have and may hereafter
become parties to this Agreement and who voluntarily signify their
consent in writing to be part of this multi-employer bargaining unit and
to be bound by this Agreement and the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements which are subject to this Agreement and any amendments,
extensions or renewals of such Agreements; provided, however, that
such Employers and the IATSE may agree upon individual adjustments
on limited matters of peculiar concern to the individual Employers as
amendments to such West Coast Studio Local Agreements, so long as
such adjustments are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Basic
Agreement. An individual Employer shall be designated as a "Producer"
and collectively as the "Producers" and as so identified shall mean only
those Employers who are parties to the instant multi-employer
bargaining unit. Each independent Producer who has become a party to
this Agreement and who has consented in writing to be part of this multi-
employer bargaining unit shall cause prompt notice thereof to be given
to the AMPTP or Contract Services Administrative Trust Fund

The IATSE insignia shall be placed on all sets, sections of
sets, props and backings, whenever feasible; the insignia, when affixed,
- 10 -

shall include the appropriate Local Union number. However, it will not
be a breach of this Agreement if, after authorization by the Producer, the
insignia is not affixed.
VII. Notices

as to a Producer if sent to such Producer at the address indicated
opposite its signature and, as to the IATSE, at the address indicated

VIII. Foremen and Supervisory Employees
Notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution and
By-laws of the IATSE or of any West Coast Local Union or in
the obligation taken by a person upon becoming a member of the IATSE
and/or any such Local Union, or otherwise, which directly, indirectly, or
impliedly places upon a foreman (or any person who is a supervisory
employee within the meaning of that term as set forth in the Labor
Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended), the duty or obligation
to accord an unlawful employment preference to members of the IATSE
and/or the Local Union, such foreman or supervisory employee shall not
give or recommend any unlawful employment preference, and the
IATSE and such Local Union shall not in any manner discipline or
threaten with discipline any such foreman or supervisory employee for
failing or refusing to give or recommend any such unlawful employment
preference.
IX. Preference of Employment
(a) With respect to employees hired by a Producer who
is part of the multi-employer bargaining unit, regardless of membership
in the AMPTP, to perform services in the County of Los Angeles,
California, or hired by such Producer in the County of Los Angeles,
California, to perform services outside such County, preference in
employment shall be given to persons having previous work experience
in the crafts and classifications of work subject to this Agreement,
obtained while employed by Producers who are part of the multi-
employer bargaining unit, in Los Angeles County or outside such
- 11 -

--- PAGE 15 of 183 ---

County if hired by such Producer in the County to perform such
services.
(b) The definite terms of such preference or seniority shall
be as set forth in the written Agreements between the Producers who are
bound to this Agreement as part of the multi-employer bargaining unit
and the IATSE and the respective West Coast Studio Locals.
(c) All West Coast Studio Local Agreements are hereby
amended to conform to this Article and, whenever reference in such
Agreements is made to a collective bargaining agreement or to an
employer for purposes of the Industry Experience Roster, such reference
shall apply only to a collective bargaining agreement subject to this
Agreement or the Videotape Agreement, and only to an Employer or
Producer who is part of the multi-employer bargaining unit.
(d) A person who retires under the Motion Picture Industry
Pension Plan or a private retirement plan specified in such Industry
Pension Plan, Article XV, shall not have any preference of employment
and shall be removed from the Studio and Industry Experience Rosters;
however, the employer may employ such employee as though he had
such preference and had not been removed from such roster.
(e) There shall be a single film-tape Industry Experience
Roster system described below based on the single multi-employer
bargaining unit of the AMPTP and those employers who consent to be
part of the above-described unit.
(f) Persons shall be eligible for placement on the
appropriate Local rosters on the following basis:
(1) Employees who, during a three hundred sixty-
five (365) day period, performed services in the multi-employer unit for
thirty (30) working days with one or more employers in Los Angeles
County (or outside Los Angeles County if hired in and transported from
Los Angeles County to perform such services) shall be eligible for
placement on the respective Industry Experience Roster (except when a
Local Agreement provides otherwise).
(2) Each applicant for roster placement shall have the
burden of establishing his or her eligibility. The applicant must file an
application with CSATF within six (6) months after the completion of
the work experience required for eligibility. Such application must be
perfected no later than one (1) year following the date of the last work
day to be considered as qualifying experience. Such application shall be
subject to appropriate verification by CSATF. The parties hereby
- 12 -

--- PAGE 16 of 183 ---

confirm that I-9 information must be provided to CSATF as a condition
of placement on the Industry Experience Roster. In addition,
satisfactory completion of the "A" safety training course and the
harassment prevention training course through CSATF is required for
placement on the Industry Experience Roster.
(g) Utilization of Rosters
(1) In the Technical Department (Article 15 of the
Videotape Agreement) and other classifications for which there is a
material difference between the function in tape and film, employees
shall be identified on the rosters for the appropriate Local by their
primary skill.
(2) Employees shall be selected from the rosters by
the Producers if they are deemed qualified and available for the
particular assignment.
(3) The requests by Producer for employees from the
roster who are to be employed under the Videotape Agreement shall be
directed to the West Coast Office of the IATSE.
(4) Employees who refuse three (3) successive calls,
whether for film or tape, must be removed from the respective roster
unless their refusal is due to work being performed for a Producer. In
this connection, it shall be noted that it is expected that one employee
may appear on more than one Local Union roster and that roster removal
requirements will be triggered only by three (3) refusals under the same
roster.
(5) A person on the Industry Experience Roster who
fails to successfully complete legally required industry safety training
courses by a date to be mutually agreed upon by the IATSE and
AMPTP, or refresher Safety Pass training and/or harassment prevention
training by a date scheduled by CSATF, shall be temporarily removed
from the Industry Experience Roster. The IATSE and AMPTP agree
that a person must complete all required courses and/or training within
six (6) months of placement on the Industry Experience Roster.
During the time the person is so temporarily
removed from such Roster, the Producer is not obligated to call such
person. The person shall be reinstated to his/her former Roster status
upon successful completion of said courses and/or training.
- 13 -

--- PAGE 17 of 183 ---

(6) The Advisory Committee will assist CSATF in
moving those listed on the Industry Experience Roster in non-existent
classifications into classifications identified in the West Coast Studio
Local Agreements.
(h) Interchange
(1) It is understood that none of the foregoing is to
affect in any way the right to interchange personnel under the Videotape
Agreement or under any of the West Coast Studio Local Agreements, to
the extent therein provided.
(2) Studio Seniority Rosters do not apply to the
Technical Department under the Videotape Agreement.
(i) Roster Certification Form
The Producer and the IATSE will jointly develop a
form for use by a Producer to notify CSATF that an individual is being
certified for roster placement. The form shall include provisions for:
(1) The number of qualifying days worked by the
employee;
(2) The roster classification within which the
employee worked; and
(3) A notation whether the work performed was
satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
The IATSE and the affected West Coast Studio Local
shall have the right to challenge any roster placement with respect to the
provisions contained in subparagraphs (1) and (2) above under the
following roster arbitration procedure.
(j) Roster Arbitration Procedure
Disputes regarding the placement or removal of any
person from the Industry Experience Roster arising from the contention
that the person is not eligible to be placed on the roster under the
applicable Agreement shall be resolved in the following manner:
(1) The IATSE and Producers select Fredric Horowitz
to act as the impartial arbitrator in all cases submitted to arbitration
under this Article, and Mark Burstein as the alternate impartial arbitrator
in the event the impartial arbitrator is unavailable or unwilling to act.
- 14 -

--- PAGE 18 of 183 ---

(2) The IATSE and the Producers agree to submit
to final and binding arbitration before the impartial arbitrator disputes
involving the placement of any person on the Industry Experience Roster
in accordance with this Article.
(3) CSATF shall notify the IATSE and the West
Coast Studio Local Unions involved of its intention to place a person on
the Industry Experience Roster. Such notice shall contain the person's
address, telephone number, Social Security number (last four digits) and
email address, provided CSATF has such information. The IATSE or
the West Coast Studio Local Union may protest the intended action of
CSATF within twenty (20) business days by a written notice to CSATF.
In the event of a protest, CSATF shall notify the Producer(s) involved
and the person. The person will not be placed on the roster until the
matter has been determined. Upon such protest, a hearing shall be
scheduled before the impartial arbitrator. If no protest is filed within ten
(10) business days, the respective parties waive the right to protest.
(4) In an arbitration conducted pursuant to this
Article, CSATF shall participate as an administrative witness and
a custodian of records, and the IATSE, or a West Coast Studio
Local Union designated in writing by the IATSE, shall represent
the IATSE. Any person whose intended roster placement is involved in
such dispute shall be entitled to have his/her own counsel at his/her own
expense present at the arbitration. This provision shall not be construed
as conferring upon such person the rights of a third party to the
arbitration, and such arbitration will be solely between the Producer(s)
and the IATSE.
(5) The impartial arbitrator shall hold a hearing
within ten (10) business days after receipt of a request from the IATSE
or Producer(s). Such hearing shall be held on an informal basis. The
arbitrator shall have the authority to establish uniform and equitable
procedures for the conduct of the hearing.
(6) The award of the arbitrator shall be rendered in
writing within ten (10) business days after the conclusion of the hearing
unless the time is expressly extended by the Producer(s) and the IATSE.
The written award of the impartial arbitrator shall be final and binding
upon the IATSE and its West Coast Studio Locals, CSATF, the
Producer(s) and any person whose roster placement is at issue. In the
event that the award of the impartial arbitrator is to place the individual's
name on the roster, the person's roster date shall be retroactive to the
date that said person would have been placed on the roster but for
said protest.
- 15 -

--- PAGE 19 of 183 ---

(7) The fees of the impartial arbitrator and the costs
of the arbitration, if any, shall be shared equally by the Producer(s) and
by the IATSE. All other costs and fees shall be borne by the party
incurring the same.
(k) Removal from Industry Experience Roster
A person shall be removed from the Industry
Experience Roster in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
various Local Agreements.
In the event of a protest, the person's name will not be
removed from the Industry Experience Roster until the matter has been
determined.
Protests involving removal shall be subject to the same
procedure outlined regarding placements, as set forth in subparagraph (j)
of this Article, "Roster Arbitration Procedure," except that when
references are made to "Producer(s)" in said procedure, such reference
shall be deemed to mean CSATF for the purpose of this removal
procedure.
The IATSE or the Local Union and CSATF may, by
mutual agreement, extend any time limits set forth in the Sections on
"Roster Arbitration Procedure" of this Article or "Removal from
Industry Experience Roster" of the applicable Local Agreements.
An employee on permanent disability status with one
Employer may not work for another Employer in the same craft and will
be removed from the Industry Experience Roster in that craft.
X. Exculpatory Clause
The Producers agree that they will not make any claim or
institute or join any suit or proceeding in any tribunal against the IATSE
by reason of, or otherwise seek to hold the IATSE responsible for any
acts, conduct or omissions on the part of any chartered Local Union or
any of its members, unless such acts, conduct or omissions were actually
and in fact instigated or done by the IATSE. In respect to any such
questions of alleged liability of the IATSE, it is agreed that the General
Executive Board or the International President or his duly designated
International Representative shall be the only body or person authorized
to act as agent or representative for and on behalf of the IATSE.
- 16 -

--- PAGE 20 of 183 ---

The IATSE, its officers, agents and members shall not be
held liable in any manner whatsoever for any strike, slowdown, work
stoppage or any other form of action which results in cessation, stoppage
or delay of work or production, unless such action is officially
authorized by the IATSE, nor will the IATSE be held liable for any
unauthorized acts or activities of its officers, agents or members. The
IATSE agrees that it will, upon receipt of notification from the
Producers of such acts or activities, promptly advise its members that
such acts or activities are unauthorized by the IATSE, and will use its
best efforts to require a discontinuance of such cessation, stoppage or
delay of work or production.
The IATSE agrees that it will not sanction any strike by any
of the West Coast Studio Locals against any Producer, except in the
event of a material breach of a provision of this Basic Agreement. Prior
to calling a material breach, the President of the IATSE shall meet with
the President of the AMPTP to discuss the matter. Such meeting shall
be without prejudice to the parties' positions as to the materiality of the
alleged breach.
XI. Short Title
This Agreement shall be referred to as the "Producer -
I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic Agreement of 2018" and shall, as of
its effective date, terminate and replace any previous Basic Agreement
between the IATSE and the respective Producers. Provided, however,
this Agreement shall not affect or discharge any obligation or right
accrued prior to August 1, 2018 under the provisions of such previous
Basic Agreement.
XII. Health Plan
(a) Producers, the IATSE, and the respective West Coast
Locals are parties to the "Agreement and Declaration of Trust
establishing the Health Plan for the Employees of the Motion Picture
Industry" (hereinafter referred to as the "Health Plan") made as of
October 20, 1952. Such Health Plan was established in accordance with
the provisions of the "Producer-I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.M.O. Supplemental
Agreement of October 25, 1951."
(b) In accordance with Article V, Sections 1 and 2 of such
Health Plan, and subject to the provisions for changes hereinafter set
forth, Producer shall make contributions to the Health Plan as follows:
- 17 -

--- PAGE 21 of 183 ---

(1) Basic Rate. A Producer which qualifies as a "$15
Million Contributor" (as defined below) shall contribute to the Health
Plan:
(i) four dollars thirty-one and three-tenths cents
($4.313) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
Producer on or after July 29, 2018 to and including August 3, 2019
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked;
(ii) four dollars forty-one and three-tenths cents
($4.413) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
Producer on or after August 4, 2019 to and including August 1, 2020
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked; and
(iii) four dollars fifty-one and three-tenths cents
($4.513) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
Producer on or after August 2, 2020 to and including July 31, 2021
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked.
It is understood that any Producer which has been
recognized or is hereafter recognized by the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans as a "$15 Million Contributor," and any entity
related to or affiliated with such Producer that exists now or may exist in
the future, qualifies as a "$15 Million Contributor."
(2) Premium Rate. A Producer which does not
qualify as a "$15 Million Contributor" shall contribute to the Health
Plan:
(i) four dollars eighty-six and three-tenths cents
($4.863) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
Producer on or after July 29, 2018 to and including August 3, 2019
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked;
(ii) five dollars sixty-one and three-tenths cents
($5.613) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
Producer on or after August 4, 2019 to and including August 1, 2020
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked; and
(iii) six dollars thirty-six and three-tenths cents
($6.363) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
- 18 -

--- PAGE 22 of 183 ---

Producer on or after August 2, 2020 to and including July 31, 2021
under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight time" and
"overtime" hours on any day worked.
(3) Commencing with the quarter ending September
30, 2018 and at the end of every subsequent calendar quarter during the
term of this Agreement, the consultants for the Health and Pension Plans
shall project the level of reserves in the Active Employees Fund for the
term of the Agreement.
If, at any time during the term of this Agreement,
the consultants project that the level of reserves in the Active Employees
Fund will fall below six (6) months, or that the level of reserves in the
Retired Employees Fund will fall below eight (8) months, then the
IATSE will reallocate up to one percent (1%) from wages and/or the
Individual Account Plan, or any combination thereof, until such time as
the reserves are restored to the six (6) or eight (8) month level, as
applicable. It is understood that this may occur more than once during
the term of this Agreement.
(c) In the event additional crafts and classifications of work
shall, as herein provided, become subject to this Agreement subsequent
to July 31, 2018, then and in such event, this Article XII shall only be
effective and applicable to employees thereafter employed hereunder by
Producer in such crafts and classifications of work, commencing as of a
date thereafter upon which the Producer and IATSE shall mutually
agree.
(d) When a minimum call is applicable and the employee
works less than the minimum call, then the minimum call shall constitute
time worked. Employees subject to this Agreement employed for full
weeks under guaranteed weekly salary schedules shall be credited with
not less than the hours guaranteed the employees under such guaranteed
weekly salary schedule. In the event such employee works in excess of
such applicable number of hours guaranteed in such weekly schedule,
then additional contributions shall be made on such excess hours
worked.
(e) For purposes of this provision, studio, nearby and
distant location employment under "on call" weekly schedules4 shall be
considered as follows:
4 Notwithstanding the increase in the number of hours on which pension, health and IAP
contributions are to be submitted for "on call" employees, it is agreed that for any period in
which the wage increase is based upon a cents-per-hour formula, salary increases for "on call"
employees for that period shall nevertheless continue to be calculated in accordance with the
parties' past practice.
- 19 -

--- PAGE 23 of 183 ---

(1) Partial week - twelve (12) hours per day;
(2) Five day week - sixty (60) hours;
(3) Six day week - seventy-two (72) hours; and
(4) Seven day week - eighty-four (84) hours.
For the sixth day not worked on distant location, health
contributions for "on call" employees shall be based on seven (7) hours.
For the seventh day not worked on distant location, health contributions
for "on call" employees shall be based on eight (8) hours.
It is understood that the parties will establish
mechanisms at the Plan level so that when the Plans receive
contributions on behalf of "on call" employees from multiple Employers
for the same period, such Employers shall be entitled to a credit against
future contributions on a pro rata basis.
(f) During the period August 1, 2018 to and including July
31, 2021:
Except for (i) eligibility standards, which shall be
maintained at the level in effect on August 1, 2011, and (ii) the usual,
customary and reasonable (UCR) schedules, which shall be maintained
at the level in effect immediately following the replacement of
INGENIX schedules in effect on August 1, 2009, all other benefits
(including the bank of hours provision and dental and vision benefits)
under the Active Employees Fund shall be maintained at the level in
effect on August 1, 2009 in the following manner:
If, at any time during the term of this Agreement, the
level of reserves in the Active Employees Fund drops below eight (8)
months, the Trustees, in conjunction with the Plan consultants, shall
review the projections as to future reserve levels. If the consultants
project, taking into account a reasonable amount of Supplemental
Markets income, that the level of reserves in the Active Employees Fund
will fall below six (6) months during the term of this Agreement, the
following steps shall be taken:
(1) First, monies received from Post '60s payments in
excess of the amount needed to fund the additional check(s) for retired
employees, as provided in Article XIII(f)(2) of the 2000, 2003, 2006 and
2009 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreements, and in excess of the
amount needed for an eight (8) month level of reserves in the Retired
Employees Fund, shall be allocated to the Active Employees Fund;
(2) Thereafter, if the consultants project, taking into
account a reasonable amount of Supplemental Markets income, that: (i)
- 20 -

--- PAGE 24 of 183 ---

the reallocation of wages and/or contributions from the Individual
Account Plan above will not restore the level of reserves in the Active
Employees Fund to six (6) months during the term of this Agreement;
and (ii) the level of reserves will drop below four (4) months during the
term of this Agreement, then employer contributions will be increased to
the amount and for such time as is necessary to create a four (4) month
reserve level for the maintained benefits.
(g) The Affordable Care Act added a provision to the
Internal Revenue Code to require a non-deductible excise tax (also
known as the "Cadillac" tax) on certain employer-sponsored health
coverage for tax years beginning in 2022. Many details about the tax,
including its calculation and assessment, remain unknown.
As a matter of mutual concern, the bargaining parties
agree in principle that the funds of the Health Plan should be used for
the Plan's participants and their dependents and not diverted to the
payment of an excise tax that is of no benefit to the Plan's participants
and their dependents.
In light of the foregoing, the bargaining parties agree to
recommend to the Directors of the Health Plan that the Health Plan shall
be operated in a manner such that no excise tax shall be owed at any
time.
(h) It is understood and agreed that with respect to the
employees subject to this Agreement who are employed by Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., the following provisions shall also apply:
For the purposes of the following provisions of this
Article, the above-mentioned Health Plan will be referred to as the
"Health Plan" and the Retirement Plan for Employees of Metro-
Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. will be referred to as the "Retirement Plan."
Notwithstanding the extension of said termination date
as aforesaid and notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of this
Article or of any provisions of the Health Plan, Producer shall not be
obligated to establish a reserve for or to make payments into the Health
Plan with respect to any employee of Producer who is or becomes a
member of the Retirement Plan on or before March 1, 1961 while he is a
member of the Retirement Plan, nor shall such employee be subject to
the Health Plan during such period (except pursuant to the provisions of
the last paragraph of this subparagraph).
An employee who became a member of the Retirement
Plan on or before March 1, 1961 shall not be considered to be subject to
- 21 -

--- PAGE 25 of 183 ---

a "union welfare contract" effective as to such employee, within the
meaning of Paragraph 36 of the Retirement Plan, during such time as he
is a member of the Retirement Plan. An employee who withdrew from
the Retirement Plan on or before March 1, 1961 shall be considered to
be subject to a "union welfare contract" effective as to such employee,
within the meaning of Paragraph 36 of the Retirement Plan.
Nothing herein set forth shall preclude an employee
who elected to remain or become a member of the Retirement Plan on or
before March 1, 1961, also to become or remain, independently and at
his own expense, subject to the Health Plan. Any employee who,
pursuant to this Article, independently and at his own expense becomes
or remains subject to the Health Plan during any period when he is also a
member of the Retirement Plan shall not be deemed to be an employee
subject to a "union welfare contract" within the meaning of Paragraph 36
of the Retirement Plan. Any such employee shall pay the same amount
into the Health Plan as would be paid or set up as a reserve with respect
to such employee by Producer had such employee not been a member of
the Retirement Plan.
Any person subject to this Agreement who continues in
the employment of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. after his normal
retirement date under the Retirement Plan, shall, during the period of
such employment after such normal retirement date, be subject to the
Health Plan.
(i) On an annual basis during the term of this Agreement,
the AMPTP, the IATSE and the Chairman of the Basic Crafts (on behalf
of the Basic Crafts Group) shall jointly review the allocation to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans from Supplemental
Markets in conjunction with the allocation of Post '60s monies. Any
agreement mutually agreed upon by them shall become a part of this
Agreement.
(j) Effective August 1, 2018, for a dental plan, the
Producer shall contribute to the Health Plan eighteen and seven-tenths
cents (18.7¢) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by
such Producer on or after August 1, 2018 under the terms of this
Agreement, including "straight time" or "overtime" hours on any day
worked. The provisions of subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) shall apply to
the provisions of this subsection.
(k) Effective August 1, 2018, for a vision care plan, the
Producer shall contribute to the Health Plan five cents (5¢) for each hour
worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer on or after
August 1, 2018 under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight
- 22 -

--- PAGE 26 of 183 ---

time" and "overtime" hours for any day worked. The provisions of
subparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) shall apply to this subsection.
(l) At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of this
Agreement, the parties will meet to determine the impact of
national/state health care reform and will negotiate new health care
provisions accordingly.
XIII. Pension Plan
(a) Producers, the IATSE and the respective West Coast
Locals are parties to the "Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan"
(hereinafter referred to as the "Pension Plan") made as of October 26,
1953. Such Pension Plan was established in accordance with the
provisions of the "Producer-I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.M.O. Amendment
Agreement of October 26, 1953."
(b) In accordance with Article III, Sections 2 and 3 of the
Pension Plan and subject to the provisions of such Pension Plan relating
to private retirement plans, the Producer shall pay into the Pension Plan
one dollar eighty and sixty-five hundredths cents ($1.8065) for each
hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer during the
period August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2021.
Such money paid by Producer into the Pension Plan
shall not constitute nor be deemed to be wages due to the individual
employees subject to this Agreement, nor shall said money paid into the
Pension Plan in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities or torts of such employees.
(c) When a minimum call is applicable and the employee
works less than the minimum call, the minimum call shall constitute time
worked. Employees subject to this Agreement employed for full weeks
under guaranteed weekly salary schedules shall be credited with not less
than the hours guaranteed the employee under such guaranteed weekly
salary schedule. In the event such employee works in excess of such
applicable number of hours guaranteed in such weekly schedule, then
additional contributions shall be made on such excess hours worked.
(d) For purposes of this provision, studio, nearby and
distant location employment under "on call" weekly schedules shall be
considered as follows:
- 23 -

--- PAGE 27 of 183 ---

(1) Partial week - twelve (12) hours per day;
(2) Five day week - sixty (60) hours;
(3) Six day week - seventy-two (72) hours; and
(4) Seven day week - eighty-four (84) hours.
For the sixth day not worked on distant location,
pension contributions for "on call" employees shall be based on seven
(7) hours. For the seventh day not worked on distant location, pension
contributions for "on call" employees shall be based on eight (8) hours.
It is understood that the parties will establish
mechanisms at the Plan level so that when the Plans receive
contributions on behalf of "on call" employees from multiple Employers
for the same period, such Employers shall be entitled to a credit against
future contributions on a pro rata basis.
(e) In the event additional crafts and classifications of work
shall, as herein provided, become subject to this Agreement subsequent
to July 31, 2018, then and in such event, this Article XIII shall only be
effective and applicable to employees thereafter employed hereunder by
Producer in such crafts and classifications of work, commencing as of a
date thereafter upon which the Producer and the IATSE shall mutually
agree.
(f) (1) The bargaining parties agree to recommend to the
Directors of the Pension Plan the following pension benefit increase(s):
(i) Contingent Pension Benefit Increase for
Active Participants Effective January 1, 2021
Effective January 1, 2021, increase the
pension benefit accrual rates set forth in (A) through (C) below by ten
percent (10%) for Credited Hours accumulated on or after January 1,
2017 through December 31, 2020 for those individuals who are active
participants in the Pension Plan on or after January 1, 2017, provided
that these new pension amounts or accrual rates shall not apply to
pensions that went into pay status before January 1, 2017 and, provided
further, that as soon as practicable following the end of the first quarter
of 2021, the Health Plan's consultants, in conjunction with the Pension
Plan's actuaries, certify that each of the Active Health Fund and the
Retired Employees Fund has at least eight (8) months of reserves as of
January 1, 2021, based upon the assumptions and methodologies,
including but not limited to the funding priorities established for
Supplemental Markets and Post '60s contributions, approved by the
bargaining parties. For those individuals who had a Break in Service
during the period commencing with January 1, 2017 to and including
- 24 -

--- PAGE 28 of 183 ---

December 31, 2020, the increase shall apply only to Credited Hours
accumulated after the date of the most recent Break in Service. (For
example, an active participant in the Pension Plan on January 1, 2021
who failed to accumulate at least two hundred (200) Vested Hours in
2018 and 2019 is entitled to the ten percent (10%) increase only for
those Credited Hours accumulated on or after January 1, 2020.) Any
retroactive payments required by the foregoing shall be made without
interest and as soon as practicable following the consultants' certification
of reserves as provided above.
In the event that the reserve levels are below
eight (8) months in the Active Health Fund or the Retired Employees
Fund on January 1, 2021, the benefit accrual rates for Credited Hours
accumulated on or after January 1, 2017 shall remain at the following
rates, unless changed pursuant to subparagraph (ii) below:
(A) $0.03729 multiplied by the
Participant's total Credited Hours accumulated during the Participant's
first ten (10) Qualified Years;
(B) $0.04972 multiplied by the
Participant's total Credited Hours accumulated during the Participant's
next ten (10) Qualified Years; and
(C) $0.04972 multiplied by the
Participant's total Credited Hours accumulated after the Participant has
completed twenty (20) Qualified Years.
(ii) Contingent Pension Benefit Increase(s)
Effective January 1, 2024 and Every Three (3) Years Thereafter5
As soon as practicable following the end of
the first quarter of 2024 and every three years thereafter ("the evaluation
year"), the Health Plan's consultants, in conjunction with the Pension
Plan's actuaries, shall determine whether each of the Active Health Fund
and the Retired Employees Fund has at least eight (8) months of reserves
as of January 1st of the evaluation year, and the Pension Plan's actuaries
shall determine whether to certify that the Pension Plan is in the Green
Zone in the evaluation year. The foregoing determinations shall be
based upon the assumptions and methodologies, including but not
limited to the funding priorities established for Supplemental Markets
and Post '60s contributions, approved by the bargaining parties.
5 This provision assumes that the term of the successor agreements to the 2018 IATSE
Basic Agreement is three (3) years. If the term of a successor agreement is for a period other
than three (3) years, the evaluation year shall be the final year of the applicable IATSE Basic
Agreement and the period of the pension benefit increase shall be equivalent to such term.

In the event that the Health Plan's
consultants certify that each of the Active Health Fund and the Retired
Employees Fund has at least eight (8) months of reserves on January 1st
of the evaluation year, and the Pension Plan's actuaries certify that the
Pension Plan is in the Green Zone in the evaluation year, the pension
benefit accrual rates shall be increased, effective January 1st of the
evaluation year, by ten percent (10%) retroactively for Credited Hours
accumulated during the three (3) year period immediately following the
most recent increase in the pension benefit accrual rate. For those
individuals who had a Break in Service during the three (3) year period
immediately preceding January 1st of the evaluation year, the increase
shall apply only to Credited Hours accumulated after the date of the
most recent Break in Service. (For example, an active participant in the
Pension Plan on January 1, 2024 who failed to accumulate at least two
hundred (200) Vested Hours in 2021 and 2022 is entitled to the ten
percent (10%) increase only for those Credited Hours accumulated on or
after January 1, 2023.) Any retroactive payments required above shall
be made without interest and as soon as practicable following the
consultants' certifications as provided above.
In the event that the reserve levels are below
eight (8) months in the Active Health Fund or the Retired Employees
Fund on January 1st of the evaluation year, or the Pension Plan is not
certified to be in the Green Zone in the evaluation year, the benefit
accrual rates for Credited Hours accumulated since the most recent
increase in the pension benefit accrual rate shall remain at the rates
provided in subparagraph (f)(1)(i)(A)-(C) above.
(2) The bargaining parties agree to recommend to the
Directors of the Pension Plan that the Pension Plan provide a thirteenth
and fourteenth check on or about November 1st of each year of this
Agreement to those retirees who retired on or before August 1, 2009,
provided that the Pension Plan's actuaries, in conjunction with the Health
Plan's consultants, determine, taking into account the costs of such
thirteenth and fourteenth checks, that: (i) at least eight (8) months of
reserves exist in each of the Active Employees Fund and the Retired
Employees Fund at that time; (ii) the Plan is certified to be in the Green
Zone in the calendar year in which the check(s) are paid; (iii) the cost of
thirteenth and fourteenth checks, if any, granted during the term of the
Agreement shall be amortized over the fifteen (15) year amortization
period commencing January 1, 2017; and (iv) if there are insufficient
funds in the Pension Plan after accounting for existing obligations to
provide both a thirteenth and fourteenth check, then a thirteenth check
will be provided.
- 26 -

--- PAGE 30 of 183 ---

The foregoing Pension Plan improvements shall not be
applicable to any Plan participant who is covered by another collective
bargaining agreement, unless such collective bargaining agreement
contains this pension and health package on an equivalent economic
basis.
(g) It is understood that the bargaining parties and the
Directors of the Pension Plan will take all necessary steps to assure the
tax deductibility of employer contributions under the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code as it now exists or is hereafter amended.
XIIIA. Motion Picture Industry Individual Account Plan
(a) The Producer shall contribute to the Individual
Account Plan, on behalf of each employee employed by the Producer
hereunder, six percent (6%) of the scale Regular Basic Hourly Rate of
pay for all hours worked by or guaranteed such employee during the
period August 1, 2018 to and including July 31, 2021. (In the case of
"on call" employees, such percentage payment shall be based on the
scale "on call" rate.)
It is understood that the parties will establish
mechanisms at the Plan level so that when the Plans receive
contributions on behalf of "on call" employees from multiple Employers
for the same time period, such Employers shall be entitled to a credit
against future contributions on a pro rata basis.
(b) The parties agree that each employee's Individual
Account Plan shall vest after one (1) qualified year.
(c) Future reallocation of Post '60s and Supplemental
Markets monies to the Individual Account Plan shall be done on the
following basis:
(1) Only that portion of the reserves in the Active
Health Plan that exceeds the amount needed to furnish benefits to
participants in such Health Plan for twelve (12) months, and that portion
of the reserves in the Retiree Health Plan that exceeds the amount
needed to furnish benefits to participants in such Health Plan for twenty
(20) months, measured as of September 30 of each year, shall be subject
to reallocation. Reserve levels shall be calculated in accordance with the
continuation value measurement methodology heretofore adopted by the
Health Plan.
- 27 -

--- PAGE 31 of 183 ---

(2) If the Pension Plan's finalized actuarial valuation
report for the prior Plan Year shows that the Pension Plan is less than
one hundred percent (100%) funded under the Pension Protection Act
("PPA"), the excess amount shall be reallocated to the Pension Plan. If
such actuarial valuation report shows that the Pension Plan is at least one
hundred percent (100%) funded, then eighty percent (80%) of the excess
amount to be reallocated shall be allocated to the accounts of
participants in the Individual Account Plan and twenty percent (20%) of
the excess amount shall be designated as a credit against future
Supplemental Markets or Post '60s payments, to be divided up among
those Companies, each of which has made Supplemental Markets
payments to the Health Plan of not less than $15,000,000 (or has made
Post '60s payments to the Retired Employees Fund of not less than
$6,000,000) in the aggregate during the three (3) year period beginning
January 1, 1994 and ending on December 31, 1996 or in any subsequent
three (3) consecutive year period. For these purposes, the Supplemental
Markets and Post '60s payments made by Columbia and TriStar shall be
aggregated and the Supplemental Markets and Post '60s payments made
by Amblin Entertainment Inc. and DreamWorks shall be aggregated.
(3) It is understood that funding of the 1996, 2000,
2003 and 2006 pension benefit increases, as described in the 1996, 2000,
2003 and 2006 Producer-IATSE Basic Agreements, shall take place
before any monies are reallocated pursuant to this subparagraph (c).
XIIIB. 401(k) Plan Feasibility Study
A committee shall be established consisting of representatives of
the Producers and the IATSE to conduct a study regarding the
establishment of a 401(k) plan funded solely by employee salary
deferrals for participants in the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan.
Among other considerations, the study will address the following:
(a) Whether the establishment and administration of the plan will
cause the Producers to incur increased costs;
(b) Whether the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plan or another entity such as a third party administrator would be able
to administer the 401(k) plan as a separate plan; and
(c) Whether the plan is likely to or can be structured to satisfy all
legal requirements for 401(k) plans (e.g., non-discrimination testing
requirements, etc.).
- 28 -

--- PAGE 32 of 183 ---

The committee shall meet as soon as practicable in the beginning
of 2019. Once the study is complete, the committee shall report the
results of the study to the bargaining parties, who will determine jointly
whether to establish a 401(k) plan, and the nature of that 401(k) plan. It
is understood that other Union parties to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plan may join the committee, if agreed by Producers.
XIV. Motion Picture Industry Health Plan - Retired Employees
Fund
(a) Producer shall, for the period commencing August 1,
2018 to and including July 31, 2021, pay to the Industry Pension Plan
through its Administrator, as agent for transmittal to the Motion Picture
Industry Health Plan - Retired Employees Fund (subject to the
provisions for changes hereinafter set forth), thirty cents (30.0¢) for each
hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer on or after
August 1, 2018 to and including July 31, 2021 under the terms of this
Agreement, including "straight time" and "overtime" hours on any day
worked.
It is agreed and recommended that as a matter of
funding policy, the Directors of the Health Plan shall continue to
maintain the level of reserves in the Retired Employees Fund at eight (8)
months at all times during the term of the Agreement.
Commencing with the quarter ending September 30,
2018 and at the end of every subsequent calendar quarter during the term
of this Agreement, the consultants for the Health and Pension Plans shall
project the level of reserves in the Retired Employees Fund for the term
of the Agreement.
(b) When a minimum call is applicable and the employee
works less than the minimum call, then the minimum call shall constitute
time worked. Employees subject to this Agreement employed for full
weeks under guaranteed weekly salary schedules shall be credited with
not less than the hours guaranteed the employee under such weekly
salary schedule. In the event such employee works in excess of such
applicable number of hours guaranteed in such weekly schedule, then
additional contributions shall be made on such excess hours worked.
(c) For the purposes of this provision, studio, nearby and
distant location employment under "on call" weekly schedules shall be
considered as follows:
- 29 -

--- PAGE 33 of 183 ---

(1) Partial week - twelve (12) hours per day;
(2) Five day week - sixty (60) hours;
(3) Six day week - seventy-two (72) hours; and
(4) Seven day week - eighty-four (84) hours.
For the sixth day not worked on distant location,
contributions to the Retired Employees Fund for "on call" employees
shall be based on seven (7) hours. For the seventh day not worked on
distant location, contributions to the Retired Employees Fund for "on
call" employees shall be based on eight (8) hours.
It is understood that the parties will establish
mechanisms at the Plan level to provide that when the Plans receive
contributions on behalf of "on call" employees from multiple Employers
for the same period, such Employers shall be entitled to a credit against
future contributions on a pro rata basis.
(d) The above rate of contribution of thirty cents ($.30) per
hour effective August 1, 2018 represents no increase over the rate of
contribution required for the period August 1, 2015 through July 31,
2018.
(e) The bargaining parties agree to recommend to the
Directors of the Motion Picture Industry Health Plan that the number of
years required to qualify for retiree health coverage in the Retired
Employees Fund shall increase, effective January 1, 2016, from fifteen
(15) qualified years to twenty (20) qualified years for participants who
have not earned at least one "Qualified Year" as of January 1, 2016.
(The definition of "Qualified Year," as used herein, is set forth in
Section 24 of Article I of the Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan
Restated 1993 Trust Agreement, revised January 2015.)
(f) During the period August 1, 2018 to and including July
31, 2021:
Except for (i) the Coordination of Benefits rules
adopted on March 28, 2011 and made retroactive to January 1, 2011,
which shall be maintained at the level in effect as of January 1, 2011,
and (ii) the usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) schedules, which
shall be maintained at the level in effect immediately following the
replacement of the INGENIX schedules in effect on August 1, 2009, all
other benefits (including dental and vision benefits) under the Retired
Employees Fund shall be maintained at the level in effect on August 1,
2009, so long as it is prudent to do so, in the following manner:
- 30 -

--- PAGE 34 of 183 ---

If the consultants project, taking into account a
reasonable amount of Post '60s income, that: (1) the reallocation of
wages and/or contributions from the Individual Account Plan as
provided in Article XII(b) above will not restore that level of reserves in
the Retired Employees Fund to eight (8) months during the term of this
Agreement; and (2) the level of reserves will fall below four (4) months
during the term of this Agreement, then employer contributions will be
increased to the amount and for such time as is necessary to create a four
(4) month reserve level for the maintained benefits.
(g) With respect to those employees who are not included
within a unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement but who are
members of a group the Producer has designated as eligible employees
in accordance with the requirements of the Industry Pension Plan and
who are participants in the Industry Pension Plan, Producer hereby
agrees that it shall likewise pay the above respective amounts for each
hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer on and
after August 1, 2018, as above defined.
(h) With respect to those employees who are members of a
private retirement plan and who are members of a group such Producer
designated in a sufficient written instrument to the Trustees of the Health
Plan as eligible for the benefits referred to in this Article XIV, such
Producer hereby agrees that it shall likewise pay the above respective
amounts for each hour worked by or guaranteed such employee by
Producer on and after August 1, 2018, as above defined.
(i) The money received by the Administrator of
the Industry Pension Plan from such payments, as above provided, shall
be kept separate and apart from any funds of the Industry Pension Plan,
and shall be paid to the Retired Employees Fund upon demand by such
Health Plan. Such Retired Employees Fund shall provide for such health
coverage and, under such conditions as the Trustees of such Health Plan
may determine to be appropriate, for the employees retired under the
Industry Pension Plan and the private retirement plans referred to
in Article XV of the "Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan."
Such money paid by Producer to the Administrator of
the Industry Pension Plan for transmittal shall not constitute nor be
deemed to be wages due to the individual employees nor shall said
money so paid into the Industry Pension Plan in any manner be liable for
or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of such employees.
(j) Effective August 1, 2018, for a dental plan, the
Producer shall pay into the Retired Employees Fund five and one-tenth
cents (5.1¢) for each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such
- 31 -

--- PAGE 35 of 183 ---

Producer on or after August 1, 2018 under the terms of this Agreement,
including "straight time" and "overtime" hours on any day worked. The
provisions of subparagraphs (b), (c) and (f) shall apply to this
subparagraph.
(k) Effective August 1, 2018, for a vision care plan, the
Producer shall pay into the Retired Employees Fund two cents (2.0¢) for
each hour worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer on or
after August 1, 2018 under the terms of this Agreement, including "straight
time" and "overtime" hours for any day worked. The provisions of
subparagraphs (b), (c) and (f) shall apply to this subparagraph.
(l) At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of this
Agreement, the parties will meet to determine the impact of
national/state health care reform and will negotiate new health care
provisions accordingly.

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement or of
any other agreement between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. and the
IATSE and/or any West Coast Local of the IATSE, Metro-Goldwyn-

XVII. Meaning of Term "Motion Picture"
It is the mutual understanding and agreement of the parties
hereto that the term "motion picture," as used in this collective
bargaining agreement and in all prior Basic Agreements between the
parties, means and includes and has always meant and included motion
pictures, whether made on or by film, tape or otherwise, and whether
produced by means of motion picture cameras, electronic cameras or
devices, or any other combination of the foregoing, or any other means,
methods or devices now used or which may hereafter be adopted.
XVIII. Pre '60 Theatrical Pictures; Pay Television
(a) The exhibition of any motion picture by television for
which a charge is paid by or assessed to or collected from the viewing
- 34 -

--- PAGE 38 of 183 ---

audience, including subscription, telemeter, or any other method
whereby a charge is paid by the viewing audience for the right to view
such motion picture, is herein referred to as "pay television."
A "free television" picture is a motion picture initially
released on television, other than pay television.
As to all motion pictures, it is recognized and
acknowledged that the Producer has the unrestricted right to use, exhibit
and market the same for any purpose, in any manner and by any method
now known or hereafter developed, and that the Producer does not
hereby relinquish or surrender any of its property rights therein. Except
as otherwise specifically provided herein, the exhibition of a motion
picture by pay television is theatrical exhibition and is merely an
extension or substitute for the theatrical box office.
(b) It is expressly understood and agreed that the IATSE
and its Locals do not and will not make any claim for compensation or
other payments with respect to the exhibition on any form of television
(whether pay television or free television) of theatrical motion pictures,
the principal photography of which commenced prior to January 31,
1960, and that, with respect to theatrical motion pictures, the principal
photography of which commenced on or after such date, Producer's only

respect to motion pictures, the principal photography of which
commenced on or after August 1, 2018, Producer's obligations shall be
those contained in this Basic Agreement.
XIX. Post '60 Theatrical Motion Pictures
(a) Theatrical motion pictures produced by Producer with
employees employed by Producer under a Basic Agreement, the
principal photography of which commenced on or after February 1,
1960, shall be governed by the following:

2021, shall be governed by Article XIX of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the wording of the second paragraph of
paragraph (a) of Article XIX of the 1973 Basic Agreement, it was the
intention and understanding of the parties that the allocation of the
percentage payments as provided for in paragraph (b) of said Article XIX
of the 1973 Basic Agreement was to apply to accountable receipts received
by Producer between February 1, 1973 and February 1, 1976 derived from
the distribution on free television of all applicable theatrical motion
pictures, the principal photography of which commenced after January 31,
1960, regardless of which Basic Agreement applies. Because of such
- 37 -

--- PAGE 41 of 183 ---

wording, however, a Producer may have allocated certain "percentage
payments" in the proportion of seventy-five percent (75%) to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension Plan and twenty-five percent (25%) to the Motion
Picture Health and Welfare Fund, instead of fifty percent (50%) to the
Pension Plan and fifty percent (50%) to the Motion Picture Industry
Retiree Health and Welfare Fund. If the Producer did so allocate
"percentage payments," such Producer shall insofar as it is concerned be
deemed to have complied with its obligations to the applicable provisions
of the 1973 Basic Agreement, but the Pension Plan shall refund to the
Retiree Health and Welfare Fund one-third (1/3) of the seventy-five
percent (75%) so allocated to the Pension Plan, and the Welfare Fund shall
refund to the Retiree Health and Welfare Fund the whole of the twenty-
five percent (25%) so allocated to the Welfare Fund.
The following provisions of this Article XIX relate and
apply only to theatrical motion pictures produced by Producer with
employees employed by Producer under this Agreement,6 the principal
photography of which commenced after July 31, 2018, which motion
pictures for the first time are, either during the term hereof or at any time
thereafter, released to free television. (Such motion pictures are referred
to in this Article as the "motion picture" or "motion pictures.") In
addition, the allocation of percentage payments provided for in
subparagraph (b) of this Article XIX shall apply to all monies payable on
and after August 1, 2018 for the distribution on free television of all
motion pictures referred to in this subparagraph (a), regardless of which
Agreement governs.
(b) (1) As to each such motion picture (other than a
motion picture included in a "qualifying transaction" described in Article
XXVIIIA.), the Producer will pay nine percent (9%), hereinafter referred
to as the "percentage payment," of the Producer's accountable receipts
from the distribution of such motion picture on free television, computed
as hereinafter provided, to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans, to be allocated as follows:

the Local #700 Amendment Agreement shall not be considered "employees employed by
Producer under this Agreement" for any purpose under this Article XIX.

of December 31, 2016 amortized over fifteen (15) years; (B) the two

employees who retired prior to August 1, 2003 pursuant to the
provisions of Article XIII(f)(2) of the 2003 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic
Agreement with any unamortized amounts remaining as of December

XIII(f)(2) of the 2006 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement with any
unamortized amounts remaining as of December 31, 2016 amortized

check), amortized over the fifteen (15) year period commencing January
1, 2017, granted in 2017 to all employees who retired on or before
August 1, 2009 pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII.(f)(2) of the
2015 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement; and (B) the two additional

retired on or before August 1, 2009 pursuant to the provisions of Article
XIII.(f)(2) of the 2018 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement, amortized
over the fifteen (15) year period commencing January 1, 2017.

(vi) Then, next, to the Active Employees Fund of
the Health Plan.
(vii) Then, next, to the extent that the level of
reserves in the Retired Employees Fund exceeds twenty (20) months,
and to the extent that the level of reserves in the Active Employees Fund
exceeds twelve (12) months, reserves in excess of such amounts shall be
reallocated as provided in Article XIIIA.(c)(2).
On an annual basis during the term of this
Agreement, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the
IATSE and the Chairman of the Basic Crafts (on behalf of the Basic
Crafts Group) shall jointly review this allocation in conjunction with the
allocation to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans of
Supplemental Markets payments. Any agreement on any reallocation of
such monies mutually agreed upon by all of these parties shall become a
part of this Agreement. The term "Basic Crafts Group," as used herein,
refers to those unions noted in this Article XIX.(e).
Exhibit A of each of the Pension Plan, Individual
Account Plan and Health Plan (and the mechanical issues addressed
therein) shall be amended to express the agreements of the bargaining
parties with respect to the foregoing allocation.
(2) The term "Producer's gross," as used herein,
means the worldwide total gross receipts of Producer derived from the
distributor of such motion picture (who may be the Producer or a
distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit
the motion picture on free television. If the distributor of the motion
picture does not distribute the motion picture directly to free television,
but employs a sub-distributor to so distribute the motion picture, then the
"Producer's gross" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived
from such sub-distributor from licensing the right to exhibit the motion
picture on free television. In case of an outright sale of the free
television distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or
country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the
income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the
"Producer's gross." If any such outright sale shall include free television
exhibition rights, and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the
computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the free
television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales
price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Producer's gross." In
reaching such determination, Producer may consider the current market
value of free television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans shall contend
- 40 -

--- PAGE 44 of 183 ---

that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may
be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided and, in the
event the Board of Arbitration shall find that such allocation was not
reasonable and fair, it shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to
be so allocated. If the outright sale includes free television distribution
rights to more than one motion picture, Producer shall likewise allocate
to each motion picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of
the free television rights and, if the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans contend that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the
question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above
provided. If the Board of Arbitration shall find that such allocation was
not fair and reasonable, it shall determine the fair and reasonable amount
to be so allocated to each motion picture. The price received on the
outright sale of only free television distribution rights in a single motion
picture shall not be subject to arbitration. Sums paid to any advertising
agency in connection with any exhibition of a motion picture on free
television shall not be included in Producer's gross.
(3) The term "accountable receipts," as used herein,
means the balance of the Producer's gross after deducting an arbitrary
forty percent (40%) of the Producer's gross for distribution fees and
expenses; except that in the case of an outright sale of free television
distribution rights, there shall be deducted only an arbitrary ten percent
(10%) of the Producer's gross for sales commissions and expenses of
sale.
(4) Producer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only
after accountable receipts are received by the Producer, but as to foreign
receipts, such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be
freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States
and, until such time, no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in
accountable receipts. Payments of amounts accruing hereunder shall be
made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter
provided. Frozen foreign receipts from free television shall be deemed
to be released on a first-in first-out basis, unless the authorities of the
foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render
such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between
the motion picture and other motion pictures distributed by the
distributor in the same ratio that receipts derived from the distribution of
the motion picture on free television within the foreign country bear to
the total receipts derived from the distribution of the motion picture and
all other motion pictures on free television within the foreign country,
during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country
involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other
- 41 -

--- PAGE 45 of 183 ---

method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S.
dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually
converted and remitted and, should any discounts, taxes, duties or
charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of
foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be
included in accountable receipts. Producer shall not be responsible for
loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing
not reasonably within the control of the Producer. The Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans shall be bound by any arrangements
made in good faith by the Producer, or for its account, with respect to the
deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall
not be considered trust funds and the Producer may freely commingle
the same with other funds of the Producer. No sums received by way of
deposits or security need be included in Producer's gross until earned,
but when the Producer is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor,
such advance shall be included in the Producer's gross.
(5) If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights
to the motion picture on free television includes as a part thereof any
filmed commercial or advertising material, the Producer shall be
permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then
current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or
advertising material and the amount so allocated shall not be included in
Producer's gross hereunder.
(6) Such payments made hereunder to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans are not and shall not in any
manner be construed to be wages due to any individual employee, nor in
any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or
torts of any employee.
(7) Within a reasonable time after the close of the
calendar or fiscal quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) calendar days,
Producer will furnish to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plans written reports, as prescribed by the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans, showing the Producer's gross received from
the sale, lease, license and distribution (whether by Producer or a
distributor) of each such motion picture on free television. Such reports
shall be furnished quarterly during each fiscal or calendar year of the
Producer. Concurrently with the furnishing of each such
report, the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such
report. All required payments shall be made by check payable to the
order of and delivered to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plans. Each such quarterly statement shall designate the title of the
motion picture involved. On request, the Producer shall make available
- 42 -

--- PAGE 46 of 183 ---

to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans all accounting
statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer, but only insofar as
such statements relate to the Producer's gross. The Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans shall have the right, at reasonable
times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they
relate to the Producer's gross. Producer shall not be required to furnish
any quarterly statement hereunder with respect to the motion picture
prior to Producer's receipt of any Producer's gross with respect to the
motion picture, or for any quarterly period during which no Producer's
gross from the motion picture is received by the Producer.
If the Producer shall fail to make any payment
provided for in this Article when and as the same becomes due and
payable, it shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month
on the unpaid balance thereof commencing to accrue ten (10) business
days after notice in writing to Producer from the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans of such delinquency.
(8) If the Producer shall sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the distribution rights to such motion picture on
free television, or shall license the distribution rights to the motion
picture on free television, Producer shall obtain from the buyer, licensee
or distributor a separate agreement, made expressly for the benefit of the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans, as herein provided,
requiring such buyer, licensee or distributor to comply with the
provisions of this Article XIX. Such agreement shall be in substantially
the following form:
"The undersigned, __________________________________
(insert name of buyer, licensee or distributor)
herein for convenience referred to as the "Buyer," hereby
agrees with _______________________________________
(insert name of Producer)
that all theatrical motion pictures covered by this Agreement
are subject to the provisions of Article XIX of the "Producer-
I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic Agreement of 2018"
relating to payments to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans on release of a theatrical motion picture to
free television; and the said buyer hereby agrees, expressly
for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans, to abide by and perform the provisions of
Article XIX of said Basic Agreement and make said
payments required thereby. It is expressly understood that
the rights of Buyer to exhibit or license the exhibition of such
motion pictures on free television shall be subject to and
conditioned upon the payment to the Motion Picture Industry
- 43 -

--- PAGE 47 of 183 ---

Pension and Health Plans as provided in Article XIX of said
Basic Agreement, and it is agreed that said Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans shall be respectively
entitled to injunctive relief and damages against Buyer in the
event such respective payments are not made.
"The undersigned agrees to keep or have access to
complete records showing the income derived from the
distribution of such motion pictures on free television
within the entire territory for which Buyer is granted
such rights and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall have the right at all reasonable times
to inspect such records. The undersigned shall give the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
prompt written notice of the date on which each motion
picture covered hereby is first telecast on free
television. An inadvertent failure to comply with said
requirement of notice shall not constitute a default by
the undersigned hereunder, provided such failure is
cured promptly after notice thereof from the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans."
Producer agrees to give notice to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans within thirty (30) days of each
sale, transfer or license of the distribution rights to such a motion picture
on free television, with the name and address of the buyer, assignee or
distributor, and to deliver to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans an executed copy of each assumption agreement entered
into by the Producer. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer
to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph (8) shall in no
event constitute a default by the Producer hereunder or a breach of this
Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice
thereof from the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans.
Upon delivery of such assumption agreement, and
on condition that the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
approve in writing the financial responsibility of the buyer, Producer, or
any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such an assumption
agreement, shall not be further liable to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans for the keeping of any such records or the
required payments insofar as they relate to the broadcast of the motion
picture on free television, and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans agrees to look exclusively to the party last executing such
an assumption agreement for the keeping of such records and payments.
- 44 -

--- PAGE 48 of 183 ---

(9) With respect to such motion picture, Producer
agrees either to:
(i) include in any chattel mortgage, pledge
or other lien or security agreement covering the motion picture,
a provision made expressly for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans to the effect that the chattel mortgagee,
pledgee, lien or security holder agrees that if such mortgage, pledge, lien
or security agreement is foreclosed, and such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or
security holder thereby obtains title to the motion picture and
subsequently exhibits the motion picture on free television, then in such
event, after such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder has
recouped its loan so secured, plus interest and all costs and expenses
incident to foreclosure, such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder
will be bound by the provisions of this Article XIX with respect
to payments to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
thereafter becoming due and payable hereunder; provided, however, that
nothing herein contained shall prevent such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or
security holder who has acquired title to the motion picture from
thereafter making a sale of the motion picture to a third party free and
clear of any limitations or obligations whatsoever. Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection (i), the rights of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans shall be subordinate to the rights of such
mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder; or
(ii) in the alternative, be bound by the
provisions of this Article XIX with respect to payments to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans, if any, due after such
foreclosure shall have been made. In the event Producer elects this
alternative, the provisions of subsection (i) above shall be inapplicable,
and if the provisions referred to in subsection (i) above are not included
in any such chattel mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement,
Producer shall be deemed to have elected the alternative provided for in
this subsection (ii).
In the event of a foreclosure referred to in
subsection (i) above, should the Producer distribute the motion picture
for such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder, Producer shall be
bound during the period of such distribution by the provisions of this
Article XIX with respect to payments due hereunder, to the same extent
as the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder under subsection (i)
above. Any such payments made by the Producer as the distributor shall
be credited against any obligation of the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or
security holder that may be due or become due to the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans under subsection (i) above; it being
- 45 -

--- PAGE 49 of 183 ---

understood that the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
shall be entitled to such respective payments but once.
The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (9)
shall not apply to any motion picture subject to any security instrument
in existence on January 31, 1965.
(10) If, after January 31, 1976, the Producer enters into
a contract with a so-called "independent producer" for the production
and financing of a theatrical motion picture and the distribution thereof
by the Producer or for the furnishing of all the employees covered
hereunder who are to be used in such theatrical motion picture (such
contract being hereinafter referred to as an "independent contract"),
Producer will include in such independent contract an agreement on the
part of the independent producer, expressly for the benefit of the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans, that the independent
producer will pay, on behalf of Producer, in the manner herein provided,
the amounts, if any, required to be paid under the provisions of this
Article XIX with respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on
the part of the independent producer be not included in any independent
contract prior to the exhibition of the motion picture on free television,
the Producer shall be liable and responsible for the payments, if any,
required to be made under the provisions of this Article XIX with
respect to such motion picture. If such agreement on the part of the
independent producer is included in the independent contract prior to
exhibition of the motion picture on free television, then the Producer
shall not be liable or responsible in any manner or to any extent with
respect to the motion picture under the provisions of this Article XIX.
The Producer will notify the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plans of any and all such independent contracts entered into by the
Producer.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision in subparagraph (b)
above to the contrary, the following shall govern the computation and
remittance of the "percentage payment" as that term is defined in
subparagraph (b) above:
(1) Definitions. For purposes of this subparagraph (c)
and for no other purpose, the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below:
(i) "Production" or "produce" shall include both
production and pre-production functions, but not post-production or
distribution functions.
- 46 -

--- PAGE 50 of 183 ---

(ii) "Prorate" or "proration" shall mean the
computation of the percentage payment by multiplying nine percent
(9%) of accountable receipts by a fraction whose numerator consists of
the total below-the-line labor cost of individuals subject to the Basic
Agreement7 or hired from the jurisdiction of the union locals referred to
in subparagraph (e) below working on the picture (whether in production
or post-production but excluding distribution -- distribution, for the
purposes of this Article, shall include all laboratory work other than that
performed by employees charged directly to a picture) and whose

locals referred to in subparagraph (e) below who are hired to perform
services in Los Angeles or hired in Los Angeles to perform services at a
distant location whether hired by a Producer itself or employed
indirectly by a Producer through loan-outs, payroll companies or
comparable employing agents; provided, however, that individuals not
specifically charged to the motion picture or who are included in general
overhead and individuals such as projectionists, drivers and publicists
engaged primarily in off-location services during the production of the
motion picture are not included in the terms "made with two or more
individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" or "Los Angeles production
crew" as those terms are used in subparagraph (c)(3) below and are not
included in either the numerator or denominator of the proration fraction
described above.
7 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall be considered "individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" and
"employees employed by Producer under this Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (c) and
subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) and (2) of this Article XIX only and for no other purpose.
Accordingly, when Producer is entitled to prorate hereunder, the salaries of all individuals
employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Amendment
Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room
Assistants shall be included in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction referred to
in subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this Article XIX.

(iv) "Foreign" means any theatrical motion
picture for which twenty percent (20%) or more of the shooting days of
principal photography takes place in a country other than the United
States, its territories or Canada.
(v) "Domestic" means any theatrical motion
picture which is not foreign.

percent (9%) of accountable receipts.
8 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871

Room Assistants shall be considered part of the "Los Angeles production crew" for purposes of
this subparagraph (c) only and not for any other purpose.
- 48 -

--- PAGE 52 of 183 ---

(iii) (A) Percentage payments on a domestic
picture shall be made on a prorated basis if a majority of the shooting
days of principal photography on the motion picture occurred outside of
the following states - Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and
Wyoming. In the event that the IATSE determines that the proration
formula set forth in this subsection (A) adversely affects Post '60s
revenues, it shall have the right to terminate same, in which case
proration on domestic pictures shall be governed by the provisions of
subsection (B) below.
(B) Percentage payments on domestic
pictures not covered by subsection (A) above or which commence
principal photography more than one hundred twenty (120) days after
the IATSE terminates the provisions of subsection (A) above shall be
made on a prorated basis if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
(1) The Los Angeles production
crew, as defined above, consists of twenty-nine (29) or fewer individuals
(no more than twenty-two (22) of whom may be hired from the
jurisdiction of the IATSE West Coast Studio Locals), and the salaries
paid to those twenty-nine (29) or fewer individuals constitute less than
fifty percent (50%) of the salaries of the entire production crew. In
determining whether twenty-nine (29) or fewer individuals are employed
on the picture, the following shall be excluded: make-up artists,
hairdressers and costumers who are specifically required to be furnished
by the Producer in accordance with the personal service contract of an
actor and those individuals engaged in post-production or distribution
functions, including, but not limited to, editing and looping regardless of
where or when those functions are performed; and
(2) A majority of the shooting days
of principal photography on the motion picture occurred outside of the
following states -- Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and

(iv) As to any domestic picture on which the
Producer intends to make percentage payments on a prorated basis, an
Application to Prorate shall be delivered by the Producer to the
Administrator of the Pension and Health Plans on or before the date that
the first percentage payment is due to the Plans from Producer. Said
Application shall contain the following information: If the right to
prorate is based upon the provisions of subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)
above, the aggregate salaries paid to the Los Angeles production crew
- 49 -

--- PAGE 53 of 183 ---

and the aggregate salaries paid to the entire production crew; the number
of shooting days of principal photography occurring in the states listed
in subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) above; the total other shooting days and
the states in which said other shooting days occurred. If the right to
prorate is based upon the provisions of subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)
above, the number of individuals on the Los Angeles production crew;
the number of such individuals who were hired from the jurisdiction of
the IATSE West Coast Studio Locals; the number and job classifications
of those individuals excluded pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph
(c)(3)(iii)(B)(1) above; the aggregate salaries paid to the Los Angeles
production crew and the aggregate salaries paid to the entire production
crew; the number of shooting days of principal photography occurring in
the states listed in subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2) above; the total other
shooting days and the states in which said other shooting days occurred.
If an Application to Prorate is submitted later than the dates specified
above, it will nonetheless be deemed granted if the identified picture
meets said criteria; provided, however, that, if he deems it necessary, the
Administrator of the Pension and Health Plans may require a Producer
submitting a late Application to Prorate to allow a special audit of the
percentage payments due and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall be reimbursed by the Producer for all reasonable fees
and expenses incurred by the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans in performing said audit.
(d) (1) Producer will furnish to the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans written reports showing the
Producer's gross received from the sale, lease, license and distribution
(whether by Producer or a distributor) on free television of each motion
picture subject to the provisions of this Article. In the written reports
filed with the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans, the
Producer shall indicate whether it is prorating on each picture being
reported and, if so, what proration percentage is being applied and the
basis for the Producer's right to prorate -- i.e., whether proration is being
applied pursuant to subparagraph (c)(2) or pursuant to subparagraph
(c)(3)(iii)(A) or pursuant to subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) above. Such
reports shall be furnished quarterly during each fiscal or calendar quarter
of the Producer. Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report,
the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such report.
All required payments shall be made by check payable to the order of
and delivered to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans.
Each such quarterly statement shall designate the title of the motion
picture involved. On request, the Producer shall make available to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans all accounting
statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer, but only insofar as
such statements relate to the Producer's gross. The Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans shall have the right, at reasonable
- 50 -

--- PAGE 54 of 183 ---

times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they
relate to the Producer's gross and -- as to any motion picture for which
Producer assumes as Buyer the obligation to make percentage payments
pursuant to subparagraph (b)(8) above -- the documents reflecting or
effectuating the purchase; provided that, with respect to these latter
documents, the Producer may require the persons examining them to
execute reasonable agreements to respect their confidentiality. Producer
shall not be required to furnish any quarterly statement hereunder with
respect to the motion picture prior to Producer's receipt of any Producer's
gross with respect to the motion picture, or for any quarterly period
during which no Producer's gross from the motion picture is received by
the Producer.
(2) For each motion picture produced by Producer
which the Producer plans to prorate (whether proration is being applied
pursuant to subparagraph (c)(2) or pursuant to subparagraph (c)(3)
above) for three (3) years after either the date of the first quarterly report
showing a percentage payment on such motion picture or the receipt by
the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans of the Producer's

maintain and make available to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans and their auditors the following information: the names of
the employees on the Los Angeles production crew; the names of the
employees on the entire production crew; the names of all individuals
subject to the Basic Agreement working on the motion picture (whether
in pre-production, production or post-production functions); the names
of all individuals who were not subject to the Basic Agreement but who
worked on the motion picture in job categories referred to either in this
Basic Agreement or in the other collective bargaining agreements
between Producer and the West Coast Studio Locals or between
Producer and the unions referred to in subparagraph (e) below; the total
below-the-line labor costs of individuals subject to the Basic Agreement
(whether in pre-production, production or post-production functions);
and the total below-the-line labor costs of all individuals working on the
motion picture in job categories referred to either in this Basic
Agreement or in the other collective bargaining agreements between
Producer and the West Coast Studio Locals or between Producer and the
unions referred to in subparagraph (e) below.
(3) As to any motion picture subject to subparagraph
(c) above for which Producer assumes the obligation to make percentage
payments pursuant to subparagraph (b)(8) above, if Producer wishes to
prorate its percentage payments for such motion picture, it shall obtain
the records provided for in subparagraph (d)(2) above from the producer
of such motion picture.

(e) The provisions of this Article XIX were negotiated by
the following unions for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans:
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees
and Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of
the United States, its Territories and Canada; Studio
Transportation Drivers, Local 399 of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters; Local 40 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; Local 724 of the

Any reference in any other collective bargaining
agreement (whether with one of the above unions or any other union or
guild) to a "percentage payment" to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans for the exhibition on free television of Post '60
Theatrical Motion Pictures is, and shall be deemed to be, a reference to
the "percentage payment" as set forth in this Article XIX, which amount
is the only amount, in the aggregate, which the Producer and all such
unions have agreed upon for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans.
The compliance by Producer with the conditions set
forth in this Article XIX likewise constitutes compliance as to all the
unions.
(f) The following provisions shall apply to "feature length
primarily animated motion pictures," as defined herein, produced by
Producer with employees employed by Producer under this Agreement,9
which motion pictures for the first time are, either during the term hereof

which consists primarily or exclusively of animated footage and has a
continuous running time of more than thirty (30) minutes. Animated
motion pictures which include live action essential to the storyline (e.g.,

above and subparagraph (g) below if produced subject to an IATSE
Basic Agreement).
(2) Contributions Required
The contributions required to be made for release
of feature length primarily animated motion pictures to free television

(i) No contributions are required to be made for
any feature length primarily animated motion picture produced and/or
released prior to November 1, 1992.
(ii) (A) With respect to those feature length

of "Producer's gross," as that term is defined in subparagraph (b)(2)
above. (The provisions of subparagraph (b)(3) are not applicable.)

"Snowballs."
(iii) With respect to any feature length primarily

above. The parties shall have the right to reallocate such contributions
as provided in subparagraph (b)(1) above.
(v) The following provisions of subparagraphs
(a) through (e) and subparagraph (g) of Article XIX are applicable to
feature length primarily animated motion pictures covered under this
subparagraph (f):
(A) subparagraphs (b)(2), (4), (5), (6), (7),
(8) and (9);
(B) The proration provision set forth in
subparagraph (c) shall be modified to read as follows:
Notwithstanding any provision in
subparagraph (f)(2) above, the following shall govern the computation
and remittance of the payment due for the release of feature length
primarily animated motion pictures to free television:
(1) If a feature length primarily
animated motion picture is produced partially with employees employed
by Producer under this Agreement10 and partially with persons working
in job categories referred to in this Basic Agreement who are not
covered under this Agreement, the percentage payment required under
subparagraphs (f)(2)(ii) and (iii) above shall be prorated by multiplying
such percentage payment by a fraction whose numerator consists of the
sum of the total below-the-line labor costs of individuals subject to the
Basic Agreement working on the picture and the total below-the-line
labor costs of individuals subject to The Animation Guild, Local #839
Agreement, if any, (whether such individuals are employed in
production or post-production, but excluding distribution--distribution,
for the purposes of this provision, shall include all laboratory work other
than that performed by employees charged directly to a picture) and
whose denominator consists of the sum of the total below-the-line labor
costs of all individuals working on the picture in job categories referred
to in this Basic Agreement and the total below-the-line labor costs of all
individuals working on the picture in job categories referred to in The
Animation Guild, Local #839 Agreement (whether in production or post-
10 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall be considered "individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" and
"employees employed by Producer under this Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (c) and
subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) and (2) of this Article XIX only and for no other purpose.
Accordingly, when Producer is entitled to prorate hereunder, the salaries of all individuals
employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Amendment
Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room
Assistants shall be included in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction referred to
in subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this Article XIX.
- 54 -

--- PAGE 58 of 183 ---

production but excluding distribution--distribution, for the purposes of
this provision, shall include all laboratory work other than that
performed by employees charged directly to a picture).
(2) "Individuals subject to the Basic
Agreement" and "employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement"11 include all persons working on the motion picture under
the terms of the Basic Agreement who are hired to perform services in
Los Angeles or hired in Los Angeles to perform services at a distant
location, whether hired by a Producer itself or employed indirectly by a
Producer through loan-outs, payroll companies or comparable
employing agents; provided, however, that individuals not specifically
charged to the motion picture or who are included in general overhead
and individuals such as projectionists and publicists engaged primarily
in off-location services during the production of the motion picture are
not included in either the numerator or denominator of the proration
fraction described above.
(3) As to any feature length
primarily animated motion picture on which the Producer intends to
make percentage payments on a prorated basis, an Application to Prorate
shall be delivered by the Producer to the Administrator of the Pension
and Health Plans on or before the date that the first percentage payment
is due to the Plans from Producer. Said Application shall contain the
following information: the aggregate salaries paid to those employees
employed by Producer under the Basic Agreement; if applicable, the
aggregate salaries paid to those employees employed by Producer
subject to The Animation Guild, Local #839 Agreement; the total
salaries paid to the entire production crew, including the salaries of
employees working in job categories referred to in the Local #839
Agreement; and the job classifications of those individuals excluded
because they perform distribution functions or because they are not
specifically charged to the motion picture or are not included in general
overhead or are engaged primarily in off-location services. If an
Application to Prorate is submitted later than the date specified above, it
will nonetheless be deemed granted if the identified picture meets said
criteria; provided, however, that if he deems it necessary, the
Administrator of the Pension and Health Plans may require a Producer
11 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local
#871 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and
Writers’ Room Assistants shall be considered "individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" and
"employees employed by Producer under this Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (c) and
subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) and (2) of this Article XIX only and for no other purpose.
Accordingly, when Producer is entitled to prorate hereunder, the salaries of all individuals
employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Amendment
Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room
Assistants shall be included in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction referred to
in subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(v)(B)(1) of this Article XIX.
- 55 -

--- PAGE 59 of 183 ---

submitting a late Application to Prorate to allow a special audit of the
percentage payments due and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall be reimbursed by the Producer for all reasonable fees
and expenses incurred by the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans in performing said audit.
(4) The provisions of subparagraph
(d) shall apply, except that conforming changes shall be made to
eliminate the references to the basis for the Producer's right to prorate
and in the language relating to the nature of the information to be
maintained and made available to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans and their auditors.
(5) The provisions of subparagraph
(e) shall apply.
(6) The provisions of subparagraph
(g) shall apply.
(7) The parties hereto acknowledge
that a resolution of the obligations of Walt Disney Pictures & Television
to make Post '60s and Supplemental Markets payments on primarily
animated feature length motion pictures was reached with the IATSE
and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans in June of
1992. The terms of that resolution are set forth in a Memorandum
Agreement executed in June of 1992. The terms of that Memorandum
Agreement supplement the provisions of this subparagraph (f); in the
event of any inconsistency between said provisions, the terms of the
Disney Memorandum Agreement shall control.
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties hereby confirm the following understanding and practices of the
Producers with respect to the Post '60s provisions:
(1) Article XIX does not require a percentage
payment to be made with respect to motion pictures on which the only
employees employed under the Basic Agreement performed post-
production (including editorial) work; and
(2) Article XIX does not require percentage payments
to be made with respect to motion pictures which are produced by a
producer which is not signatory to the Basic Agreement (and the Basic
Crafts Agreements).
- 56 -

--- PAGE 60 of 183 ---

(3) The Post '60s provisions apply only to theatrical
motion pictures "produced by Producer with employees employed under
this Agreement."12 The parties have agreed that the quoted language is
satisfied only if two (2) or more employees are employed on the
production under either the IATSE Agreement or the Basic Crafts
Agreements. This requirement is not satisfied if there is only one
employee covered under the Basic Agreement and one employee
covered under the Basic Crafts Agreements.
(i) The "Domestic Pictures" proration
provisions of the Post '60s clause provide that certain domestic pictures
are eligible for proration of Post '60s payments if, among other
requirements, the Los Angeles production crew consists of twenty-nine
(29) or fewer individuals (no more than twenty-two (22) of whom may
be hired from the jurisdiction of the IATSE West Coast Studio Locals).
In determining whether either the "29 or fewer" or "22 or fewer"
requirement has been met, employees who replace other employees are
not counted. For example, suppose there are seven (7) persons on the
crew who fall within the Los Angeles production crew definition,
including the Director of Photography. Suppose further that the Director
of Photography is replaced with another person hired from the
jurisdiction of Local #600. The replacement Director of Photography
would not be counted in figuring whether the "29 or fewer" or "22 or
fewer" standards were met.
However, the salary paid to any replacement
employee under these circumstances shall be included in both the
numerator and denominator.
(ii) Similarly, individuals hired from either the
jurisdiction of the IATSE West Coast Studio Local Unions or from the
jurisdiction of the Basic Crafts Unions who are replaced with another
individual employed under the same West Coast Studio Local
Agreement or Basic Crafts Agreement, respectively, shall not be counted
in determining whether a motion picture has been produced by a
Producer with "employees" employed under this Agreement.13
12 Employees employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall not be considered "employees employed under this Agreement" for
purposes of subparagraph (g)(3) of this Article XIX.
13 Employees employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall not be considered "employees employed under this Agreement" for
purposes of subparagraph (g)(3) of this Article XIX.
- 57 -

--- PAGE 61 of 183 ---

For example, if the only individual hired
from the jurisdiction of the West Coast Studio Local Unions and the
Basic Crafts Unions on a particular production is an Art Director, and
the Art Director is replaced on that production by another Art Director
hired from the jurisdiction of Local #800, there will still be only one (1)
employee hired from the jurisdiction of the IATSE on the production,
with the result that the Post '60s clause is not applicable to that
production.
XX. Policy, Applicability of Agreement and Subcontracting
(a) The purposes of this Article are to protect and preserve
the work opportunities available to employees covered by this
Agreement who have traditionally and historically performed the work
covered by the classifications and job duties set forth in this Agreement,
the Videotape Agreement, and the West Coast Studio Local Agreements.
These purposes are accomplished as follows:
(b) Policy
It is the policy of the Producer not to evade
intentionally the provisions of this Agreement, the Videotape
Agreement, and the West Coast Studio Local and Basic Crafts
Agreements by participating in the production of a motion picture, by
providing financing or the guarantee thereof for the production of said
motion picture, which picture has direct labor costs for bargaining unit
work (other than a minimal amount) less favorable than those provided
for under this Agreement, the Videotape Agreement, and the West Coast
Studio Local Agreements or other applicable collective bargaining
agreements.
Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to extend the
scope or jurisdiction of this Agreement, the Videotape Agreement or the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements.
Negative pick-up transactions, distribution transactions,
and production-distribution transactions which are bona fide are not
covered by this Article XX, except that in the event the Producer enters
into a production-distribution transaction, by providing financing or the
guarantee thereof for the production of a motion picture under this
Section, then the Producer shall notify the IATSE and Basic Crafts in
writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of principal
photography, providing the name of such motion picture, the name of the
Producer and corporate entity and/or principals. If there are unusual
- 58 -

--- PAGE 62 of 183 ---

circumstances in which the Producer cannot give such thirty (30) days
notice, the Producer shall give at least ten (10) days notice prior to the
commencement of principal photography.
(c) Applicability of Agreement
This Agreement shall be binding on the signatories
hereto and all parties who by reason of mergers, consolidations,
reorganizations, sale, assignment or the like shall succeed to, or become
entitled to, a substantial part of the production business of any signatory,
in and limited to Los Angeles County, California.
(d) Subcontracting
The parties recognize the existence of past
subcontracting practices within the multi-employer bargaining unit. The
parties agree that the rights, limitations and restrictions upon
subcontracting practices set forth in the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements shall remain in effect.
The Producer, as a matter of preservation of work for
employees who have historically and traditionally performed work under
the crafts and classifications as set forth in this Agreement, the
Videotape Agreement or the West Coast Studio Local Agreements,
agrees that as to bargaining unit work of a type which has not heretofore
been subcontracted in the multi-employer bargaining unit, the Producer
will subcontract such bargaining unit work to any other person,
corporation, joint venture or entity only: (1) if the Producer first notifies
the IATSE in writing of its intention to subcontract, and (2) the direct
labor costs of the person, corporation, joint venture or entity who will
perform such work under said subcontract are not less than the direct
labor costs set forth in this Agreement, the Videotape Agreement, the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements or other applicable collective
bargaining agreements; or (3) if the Producer lacks the requisite
technology, facilities or equipment to perform the work.
(e) In order to effectively enforce the provisions of this
Article, the Producer agrees that records in its possession or those to
which the Producer has access pertaining to direct labor costs will be
made available for inspection within twenty (20) days after a written
request therefor by the IATSE.
(f) A complaint by the IATSE of a violation of this Article
shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days after a written request to a
special Producer-IATSE Committee for a resolution. The Producer's
representation on the Committee shall consist of the AMPTP and the
- 59 -

--- PAGE 63 of 183 ---

Producer involved in the complaint. Upon agreement by the AMPTP,
the Producer involved and the IATSE, the decision of the Committee
shall be final and binding on the Producer involved and the IATSE. If
no resolution is reached by the Committee, the IATSE shall have the
right to submit the dispute to a final and binding regular arbitration
procedure as set forth in Article XXXII(b) of this Agreement.
XXI. Charitable Contributions
Deductions made by Producer from the employee's pay check
for charitable institutions shall be paid by Producer to such institutions
within two (2) weeks after such deductions are made from the pay check.
The IATSE shall give the Producer notice of any such failure to pay the
institution and if the Producer fails to make such required payment
within seven (7) days after such notice, such failure shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Agreement by such delinquent Producer.
As to those Producers who, by prior arrangement with the
respective institution or institutions, make such payments on a quarterly
or other basis, then such above-mentioned two (2) week period shall be
extended to the quarterly or other time basis as so arranged.
XXII. Annual Meetings
During the term of this Agreement, the IATSE and AMPTP
shall jointly sponsor meetings to be held not less frequently than once
per calendar year, on a day or days to be mutually agreed upon at least
one month in advance. The meetings shall focus on appropriate subjects
mutually agreed upon by the parties. As the parties reach agreements on
subjects, the Basic Agreement and/or the applicable Local Agreements
shall be modified accordingly.
Each Producer agrees to provide the IATSE with a copy of its
policies regarding hotel accommodations for employees who work long
hours.
XXIII. Documentaries, Industrial and Educational
The Producers, the IATSE and the Basic Crafts will continue
to negotiate in order to arrive at a separate agreement regarding the
making of documentaries, educationals and industrials.
- 60 -

--- PAGE 64 of 183 ---

XXIV. Non-Discrimination
The parties agree to continue to comply with all applicable
federal and state laws relating to non-discriminatory employment
practices.
Claims alleging a violation of this "Non-Discrimination"
provision are not subject to arbitration, but are instead subject to non-
binding mediation.
XXV. Contract Services Administration Trust Fund
(a) Producer shall pay to the Industry Pension Plan through
its Administrator, as agent for transmittal to the Contract Services
Administration Trust Fund ("CSATF"), for employees who are subject to
the Retired Employees Fund (on the same weekly and daily formula as
the contributions paid under the Retired Employees Fund) for the period
commencing August 1, 2018 to and including July 31, 2021: (i) fifty-
three cents ($0.53) per hour for each hour worked by or guaranteed such
employee by such Producer on or after July 29, 2018 to and including
August 1, 2020; and (ii) sixty cents ($0.60) per hour for each hour
worked by or guaranteed an employee by such Producer on or after
August 2, 2020 to and including July 31, 2021; provided, however, that
in place and stead of the above cents per hour payments, such payments:
(1) with respect to employees of laboratories, shall be
at the rate of one and five-tenths cent ($0.015) per hour on or after July
29, 2018 to and including August 1, 2020 (one and seven-tenths cent
($0.017) per hour on or after August 2, 2020 to and including July 31,
2021);
(2) with respect to Production Office Coordinators,
Assistant Production Office Coordinators and Art Department
Coordinators employed under the Local #871 Amendment Agreement,
shall be at the rate of eight and two-tenths cents ($0.082) per hour for the
period beginning July 29, 2018 to and including August 1, 2020 (nine
and two-tenths cents ($0.092) per hour for the period beginning August
2, 2020 to and including July 31, 2021); and
(3) with respect to Script Coordinators and Writers'
Room Assistants employed under the Local #871 Agreement provisions
covering Script Coordinators and Writers' Room Assistants, shall be at
the rate of seven and eight-hundredths cents ($0.0708) per hour for the
period beginning July 29, 2018 to and including July 31, 2021.
- 61 -

--- PAGE 65 of 183 ---

The Producers have established CSATF for the purpose
of providing a Fund to be used for the administration of apprenticeship
and other training programs within the motion picture industry;
maintenance of appropriately classified and delineated seniority rosters
within the motion picture industry; administration of safety programs
and studies within the motion picture industry; administering and
financing physical examinations in connection with any uniform
industry retirement programs; and, generally, for the carrying on of
similar such programs for the administration of other industry-wide
services, studies or education. To this end, the parties have agreed,
effective August 1, 2018, to renew the Industry Experience Roster
Safety Requirement Training for the term of this Agreement. Such Trust
Fund shall be administered by a Board of Trustees who shall be
appointed by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
(b) CSATF shall provide Second Step grievance services.
(c) The money received by the Administrator of the
Industry Pension Plan from such payments, as above provided, shall be
kept separate and apart from any funds of the Industry Pension Plan and
shall forthwith be paid to CSATF.
Such money so paid by Producer shall not constitute
nor be deemed to be wages due to the individual employees nor shall
said money so paid be in any manner liable for or subject to the debts,
contracts, liabilities or torts of such employees.
The Producers shall provide the IATSE with the
CSATF certified annual financial statements and its quarterly activity
statement.
A CSATF advisory committee, composed of
representatives from the IATSE, has been established. The Advisory
Committee shall assist in establishing electronic communications (e-
mail) with all Local Unions.
(d) All Industry Experience Rosters of those employees
subject to CSATF are to be administered under CSATF.
The Special Effects Qualification Committee, as
provided for in Paragraph 68 of the Local #44 Agreement, shall be
reconstituted to provide for the use of qualifications tests designed to
measure whether the individual tested possesses the necessary
knowledge and skills required to meet the minimum requirements of the
classification for which the test is designed.
- 62 -

--- PAGE 66 of 183 ---

If, at any time, it appears to CSATF that the test(s) has
(have) a disparate impact under federal and state laws and regulations
pertaining thereto, CSATF shall review such test(s). If, after reviewing
the test(s), CSATF determines that such disparate impact cannot be
eliminated, CSATF shall cease the use of such test(s) and shall
immediately attempt to revise the method of testing.
(e) The Producers will establish a procedure whereby any
interested party may contact CSATF to obtain information relative to the
past employment of an individual on a specific motion picture. In
response to such an inquiry, CSATF will make a good faith effort to
contact the involved Producer and secure such information on behalf of
the interested party. The Producer, on its part, will make a good faith
effort to respond to such inquiries by CSATF.
The provisions of this Article are made expressly for the
benefit of CSATF.
XXVA. IATSE Training Trust Fund
Effective October 10, 2018, Producer shall contribute to the IATSE
Training Trust Fund ("IATTF") on behalf of employees employed on
theatrical motion pictures, television motion pictures or "High Budget
SVOD Programs" (as defined in the Sideletter re Productions Made for
New Media) under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local
#700 Amendment Agreement (other than in the "Third Area" as defined
in those Amendment Agreements) for whom contributions to CSATF are
not otherwise due. The contribution rate shall be as provided in, and
subject to the same conditions as set forth in, the then-current Theatrical
and Television Motion Picture Area Standards Agreement ("ASA"),
which rate is fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour during the term of this
Agreement for each hour worked by such employee up to a maximum of
twelve (12) hours per day. Contributions for employees whose rates are
subject to individual negotiation shall be made on the basis of twelve
(12) hours per day.
XXVI. Implementation of Work Training and Apprenticeship
Programs
The Producers and the IATSE agree to cooperate in the
establishment of work training and/or apprenticeship programs with
respect to appropriately agreed-upon work classifications subject to this
Agreement, in conformance with all applicable affirmative action
programs, and specifically including the classifications of work covered
- 63 -

--- PAGE 67 of 183 ---

under the Agreement of the IATSE and its West Coast Locals. A
committee shall be convened for the purpose of formulating and
implementing training programs.
The parties recognize that deductions from hourly
contributions (in the amount of one cent (1¢) from contributions made at
the rate of two and one-quarter cents (2¼¢) per hour and in the amount
of one-third cent (1/3¢) from contributions made at the rate of three-
quarters cents (3/4¢) per hour) have been made under previous collective
bargaining agreements for the purpose of providing training or other
agreed-upon programs for the benefit of persons who suffer
displacement as a result of the introduction and utilization of electronic
technology. The parties agree that any CSATF monies which were
earmarked for exclusive use in providing training or other programs to
persons who suffered displacement as a result of the introduction and
utilization of electronic technology may be released to cover
expenditures required for any other agreed-upon training programs for
IATSE classifications in addition to covering expenditures for
continuing videotape retraining programs. Any person who successfully
completes an approved, bona fide training program offered through
CSATF shall be entitled to placement on the appropriate roster for which
trained.
XXVII. Rental Facilities Notice
The Producers shall provide the IATSE timely advance
written notice of a rental facility deal for use of its Los Angeles studio
production facilities when it has no financial interest in the picture. The
Producer shall give telephonic notice prior to the written notice.
XXVIII. Supplemental Markets

--- PAGE 68 of 183 ---

(2) Produced with employees employed by Producer
under this Agreement.14
(3) Definition
The term "Supplemental Markets," as used in this

paragraph (3)), or pay television, as those terms are hereafter defined in
this paragraph (3), and the exhibition of television motion pictures on
any commercial carrier such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and

(i) Cassettes:
For the purposes of this Article, a cassette is

comparable device. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a
television receiver or comparable device in the home or in closed-circuit
use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes "Supplemental Markets."
(ii) Pay Television

(b) the subscriber pays for the motion
picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or
motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not
be considered pay television); and/or
14 Employees employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall not be considered "employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Article XXVIII. Employees employed
under the Local #700 Amendment Agreement shall not be considered "employees employed by
Producer under this Agreement" for any purpose under this Article XXVIII.
- 65 -

--- PAGE 69 of 183 ---

(c) the subscriber pays a fee for an
encoded telecast, which fee is a substantial charge relative to other fees
paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services
and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly
understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
The term "pay television," as used in this Article,
shall also include the exhibition of motion pictures through a television
receiver or comparable device by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit,
satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the
individual viewer or by the hotel, motel, hospital or other
accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by
making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in
theaters or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and
shall not be considered pay television.
The term "Supplemental Markets" does not
include the exhibition of a motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a
television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition, and for this
purpose "theatrical exhibition" includes the educational market, the
exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier
(referred to herein as "in-flight"), such as commercial airlines, trains,
ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered
theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures, other than the specific
home use hereinabove defined as the "Supplemental Markets" for
cassettes.
Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to
pay television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses
of motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the
subscriber for the program viewed, or for which the subscriber has the
option, by additional payment, to receive special programming over one
or more special channels. When no program charge or special channel
charge is made to the subscriber in addition to the general charge, the
transmission of motion pictures by telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite
or CATV is free television exhibition for the purposes of this
Agreement, and such exhibition shall not be considered Supplemental
Markets exhibition.
The Producers have agreed to the inclusion of
"pay television" in the "Supplemental Markets" because, under the
present pattern of distribution of motion pictures, "pay television" is
supplemental to the primary market. The Producers reserve the right in
future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so
- 66 -

--- PAGE 70 of 183 ---

that "pay television" is no longer a Supplemental Market but constitutes
or is a part of the primary market of distribution of motion pictures, and
that, therefore, no additional payment pursuant to this Article XXVIII
should be made with respect to the release of motion pictures (including
those covered by this Agreement) in said market. Nothing herein shall
limit the scope of negotiations on said subject. Furthermore, if the
Producers in their collective bargaining agreement with the Directors
Guild of America, Writers Guild of America or Screen Actors Guild-
American Federation of Television and Radio Artists negotiate a
provision treating pay-per-view exhibitions as part of the primary
market, rather than supplemental markets, then such provision shall
automatically be deemed included hereunder, based on a comparable
formula as may have been applied in such DGA, WGA or SAG-AFTRA
Agreement.
(b) (1) As to such motion pictures distributed in
Supplemental Markets other than by means of cassettes (other than a
motion picture included in a "qualifying transaction" described in Article
XXVIIIA.), the following shall apply:
(i) The Producer will pay five and four-tenths
percent (5.4%) (hereinafter referred to as the "percentage payment") of
the "Producer's gross" received therefrom, computed as hereinafter
provided.
(ii) The term "Producer's gross," as used herein,
means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of the
motion picture (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the
Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit the motion picture in
Supplemental Markets other than by means of cassettes and including, in
the case of a "foreign territorial sale" by the Producer, the income
received from such sale by Producer but not the income received by
"purchaser" or the "licensee."
(2) As to such motion pictures distributed in
Supplemental Markets by means of cassettes (other than a motion picture
included in a "qualifying transaction" described in Article XXVIIIA.),
the following shall apply:
(i) The Producer will pay six and seventy-five
hundredths percent (6.75%) of the "Producer's gross," as defined below,
until the Producer's gross equals one million dollars ($1,000,000).
Thereafter, Producer shall pay eight and one-tenth percent (8.1%) of
"Producer's gross" in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000).
- 67 -

--- PAGE 71 of 183 ---

(ii) If the Producer is the Distributor or the
Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Producer's
gross" derived from the distribution of such motion pictures by cassettes
shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts
derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the
retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made
as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer,
and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be
"Producer's gross." The reasonableness of such allocation shall be
subject to arbitration and, in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade
practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-
related companies shall be relevant evidence.
If the Distributor is not the Producer and is
not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the "Producer's gross" shall
be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer
from licensing the right to distribute such motion picture by cassettes.
(3) The Producer's gross shall not include:
(i) Sums realized or held by way of deposit, as
security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-
returnable;
(ii) Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes
returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set
up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(iii) Sums required to be paid or withheld as
taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based
on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be
remitted to or by the Producer, but there shall not be excluded from
Producer's gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or
similar tax payable by the Producer or such distributor on its net income
or for the privilege of doing business;
(iv) Frozen foreign currency until the Producer
shall either have the right to freely use such foreign currency, or
Producer has the right to transmit to the United States such foreign
currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. If such
currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed
to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at
which said currency was actually transmitted to the United States as
aforesaid, or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free
market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit
occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the
- 68 -

--- PAGE 72 of 183 ---

basis of "first-in, first-out" unless otherwise allocated by local foreign
fiscal authorities. Allocation of such unblocked funds as between
revenue which serves as the basis of determining payments hereunder
and other revenue shall be on a proportional basis, subject to different
earmarking by local foreign fiscal authorities.
(v) Sums paid to any advertising agency in
connection with any exhibition of a motion picture in Supplemental
Markets.
(4) Such monies shall be paid to the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans and shall be allocated as follows:
(i) First, to the Pension Plan to fund the
difference between (A) the "actuarially-required" contributions for the
year, taking into account benefit increases and five (5) year vesting, and
(B) the expected contributions for the Pension Plan year, subject to
specified actuarial methods, provided that there are sufficient funds in
the Active Employees Fund of the Health Plan to maintain benefits and a
six (6) month reserve;
(ii) Then, next, to the Retired Employees Fund
of the Health Plan to the extent needed to fund an eight (8) month
reserve;
(iii) Then, next, to the Pension Plan to the extent
that Post '60s monies (as provided in Article XIX.(b)(1)(iii) of this
Agreement) are insufficient to fund (A) the cost of the two additional
checks (i.e., a 13th and 14th check) granted to all employees who retired
on or before August 1, 2009 pursuant to the provisions of Article
XIII.(f)(2) of the 2015 Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement and (B) the
cost of the two additional checks (i.e., a 13th and 14th check), or one
additional check (a 13th check), granted to all employees who retired on
or before August 1, 2009 pursuant to the provisions of Article XIII.(f)(2)
of this Agreement;
(iv) Then, next, to fund the Active Employees
Fund of the Health Plan;
(v) Then, next, to the extent that the level of
reserves in the Retired Employees Fund exceeds twenty (20) months,
and to the extent that the level of reserves in the Active Employees Fund
exceeds twelve (12) months, reserves in excess of such amounts shall be
reallocated as provided in Article XIIIA.(c)(2).
- 69 -

--- PAGE 73 of 183 ---

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
subparagraph (a) above, such allocation shall apply to monies payable
on and after August 1, 2018 for the distribution of motion pictures in
Supplemental Markets, regardless of which Basic Agreement applies.
On an annual basis during the term of this
Agreement, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, the
IATSE and the Chairman of the Basic Crafts (on behalf of the Basic
Crafts Group) shall jointly review this allocation in conjunction with a
review of the allocation of Post '60s monies. Any agreement on any
reallocation of such monies mutually agreed upon shall become a part of
this Agreement. The term "Basic Crafts Group," as used herein, refers to
those unions noted in this Article XXVIII.(e).
Exhibit A of each of the Pension Plan, Individual
Account Plan and Health Plan (and the mechanical issues addressed
therein) shall be amended to express the agreements of the bargaining
parties with respect to the foregoing allocation.
(5) Such gross income realized in foreign currency in
any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted
to United States dollars at the prevailing market rate of exchange at the
close of such reporting period, except that when such gross income has
actually been transmitted to the United States, it shall be deemed
converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such
foreign currency was actually so transmitted.
(6) Allocation of Producer's Gross
If any agreement for distribution in the
Supplemental Market includes more than one motion picture, or includes
both Supplemental Market rights and other rights, the Producer shall
make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments
due hereunder. If the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
contend that such allocation is not reasonable, then such claim shall be
submitted to arbitration.
(7) Producer's obligation shall accrue hereunder only
after "Producer's gross" is received by the Producer. Payments of
amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of
quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided. Should any discounts,
taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or
remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain
thereafter shall be included in "Producer's gross." Producer shall not be
responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any
matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Producer. The
- 70 -

--- PAGE 74 of 183 ---

Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans shall be bound by any
arrangement made in good faith by the Producer, or for its account, with
respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign
receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Producer may freely
commingle the same with other funds of the Producer.
(8) If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights
to the motion picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof
any filmed commercial or advertising material, the Producer shall be
permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then
current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or
advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in
Producer's gross hereunder.
(9) Such payments made hereunder to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans are not and shall not in any
manner be construed to be wages due to any individual employee, nor in
any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or
torts of any employee.
(10) Within a reasonable time after the close of the
calendar or fiscal quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) calendar days,
Producer will furnish to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plans written reports showing the Producer's gross received from the
sale, lease, license and distribution (whether by Producer or a
distributor) of each such motion picture in such Supplemental Markets.
Such reports shall be furnished quarterly for each fiscal or calendar
quarter of the Producer. Concurrently with the furnishing of each such
report, the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such
report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of and
delivered to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans. Each
such quarterly statement shall designate the title of the motion picture
involved. On request, the Producer shall make available to the Health
Plan all accounting statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer,
but only insofar as such statements relate to the Producer's gross. The
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans shall have the right, at
reasonable times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar
as they relate to the Producer's gross. Producer shall not be required to
furnish any quarterly statement hereunder with respect to the motion
picture prior to Producer's receipt of any Producer's gross with respect to
the motion picture, or for any quarterly period during which no
Producer's gross from the motion picture is received by the Producer.
The parties agree that they will work through the
auspices of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans to
- 71 -

--- PAGE 75 of 183 ---

implement reporting of Supplemental Markets income by medium, as
soon as it is feasible to do so.
If the Producer shall fail to make any payment
provided for in this Article when and as the same becomes due and
payable, it shall bear interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month
on the unpaid balance thereof commencing to accrue ten (10) business
days after notice in writing to Producer from the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans of such delinquency.
(11) If the Producer shall sell, assign, transfer or
otherwise dispose of the distribution rights to such motion picture in
such Supplemental Markets, or shall license the distribution rights to the
motion picture in such Supplemental Markets, Producer shall obtain
from the buyer, licensee or distributor a separate agreement, made
expressly for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans, requiring such buyer, licensee or distributor to comply
with the provisions of this Article XXVIII. Such agreement shall be in
substantially the following form:
"The undersigned, _________________________
(insert name of buyer, licensee or distributor)
herein for convenience referred to as the 'Buyer,'
hereby agrees with ________________________
(insert name of Producer)
that all motion pictures covered by this Agreement
are subject to the provisions of Article XXVIII of
the 'Producer-I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic
Agreement of 2018' relating to payments to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
on release of a motion picture to Supplemental
Markets and the said Buyer hereby agrees,
expressly for the benefit of the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans to abide by and
perform the provisions of said Basic Agreement
and make said payments required thereby. It is
expressly understood and agreed that the rights of
Buyer to exhibit or license the exhibition of such
motion picture in such Supplemental Markets
shall be subject to and conditioned upon the
payment to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans, as provided in Article XXVIII
of said Basic Agreement, and it is agreed that said
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
shall be entitled to injunctive relief and damages
- 72 -

--- PAGE 76 of 183 ---

against Buyer in the event such payments are not
made.
"The undersigned agrees to keep or have access to
complete records showing the income derived
from the distribution of such motion pictures in
such Supplemental Markets within the entire
territory for which Buyer is granted such rights
and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall have the right at all reasonable
times to inspect such records. The undersigned
shall give the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans prompt written notice of the date
on which each motion picture covered hereby is
first released in such Supplemental Markets. An
inadvertent failure to comply with said
requirement of notice shall not constitute a default
by the undersigned hereunder, provided such
default is cured promptly after notice thereof from
the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health
Plans."
Producer agrees to give notice to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans within thirty (30) days of each
sale, transfer or license of the distribution rights to such a motion picture
for Supplemental Markets, with the name and address of the Buyer,
assignee or distributor, and to deliver to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans an executed copy of each assumption
agreement entered into by the Producer. An inadvertent failure on the
part of the Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this
subparagraph (11) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer
hereunder or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is
cured promptly after notice thereof from the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans.
Upon delivery of such assumption agreement, and
on condition that the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
approve in writing the financial responsibility of the Buyer, Producer, or
any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such an assumption
agreement, shall not be further liable to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans for the keeping of any such records or the
payment required hereunder insofar as they relate to the exhibition of the
motion picture in Supplemental Markets, and the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans agree to look exclusively to the party
last executing such an assumption agreement for the keeping of such
records, payment and compliance with credit obligations.
- 73 -

--- PAGE 77 of 183 ---

(12) With respect to such motion picture, Producer
agrees either to:
(i) include in any chattel mortgage, pledge or
other lien or security agreement covering the motion picture a provision,
made expressly for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans, to the effect that the chattel mortgagee, pledgee, lien
or security holder agrees that if such mortgage, pledge, lien or security
agreement is foreclosed, and such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security
holder thereby obtains title to the motion picture and subsequently
exhibits the motion picture in Supplemental Markets, then in such event,
after such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder has recouped its
loan so secured, plus interest and all costs and expenses incident to
foreclosure, such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder will be
bound by the provisions of this Article XXVIII with respect to payments
to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans thereafter
becoming due and payable thereunder; provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall prevent such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security
holder who has acquired title to the photoplay from thereafter making a
sale of the motion picture to a third party free and clear of any
limitations or obligations whatsoever. Except as otherwise provided in
this subsection (i), the rights of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans hereunder shall be subordinate to the rights of such
mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder; or
(ii) in the alternative, be bound by the
provisions of this Article XXVIII with respect to payments to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans, if any, due after such
foreclosure shall have been made. In the event Producer elects this
alternative, the provisions of subsection (i) above shall be inapplicable,
and if the provisions referred to in subsection (i) above are not included
in any such chattel mortgage, pledge, lien or security agreement,
Producer shall be deemed to have elected the alternative provided for in
this subsection (ii).
In the event of a foreclosure referred to in
subsection (i) above, should the Producer distribute the motion picture
for such mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder, Producer shall be
bound during the period of such distribution by the provisions of this
Article XXVIII with respect to payments due hereunder, to the same
extent as the mortgagee, pledgee, lien or security holder under
subsection (i) above. Any such payments made by the Producer as the
distributor shall be credited against any obligation of the mortgagee,
pledgee, lien or security holder that may be due or become due to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans under subsection (i)
- 74 -

--- PAGE 78 of 183 ---

above; it being understood that the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall be entitled to such payments but once.
The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph
(12) shall not apply to any motion picture subject to any security
instrument in existence on the effective date of this Agreement.
(13) If, after the effective date of this Agreement, the
Producer enters into a contract with a so-called "independent producer"
for the production and financing of a theatrical motion picture and the
distribution thereof by the Producer (such contract being hereinafter
referred to as an "independent contract"), Producer will include in such
independent contract an agreement on the part of the independent
producer expressly for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans that the independent producer will pay, in the
manner herein provided, the amounts, if any, required to be paid under
the provisions of this Article XXVIII with respect to such motion
picture. If such agreement on the part of the independent producer be
not included in any independent contract prior to the exhibition of the
motion picture in the Supplemental Markets, the Producer shall be liable
and responsible for the payments, if any, required to be made under the
provisions of this Article XXVIII with respect to such motion picture. If
such agreement on the part of the independent producer is included in
the independent contract prior to exhibition of the motion picture in the
Supplemental Markets, then the Producer shall not be liable or
responsible in any manner or to any extent with respect to the motion
picture under the provisions of this Article XXVIII. The Producer will
notify the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans of any and
all such independent contracts entered into by the Producer.
(14) If Producer increases the present Supplemental
Markets "percentage payments" amount of "Schedule of Payments" in
any other collective bargaining agreement to which the Producer is or
becomes a party (e.g., actors), then the five and four-tenths percent
(5.4%) percentage payment, the six and seventy-five hundredths percent
(6.75%) percentage payment and the eight and one-tenth percent (8.1%)
percentage payment provided above in this Supplemental Markets
provision shall be correspondingly increased.
(c) Notwithstanding any provision in subparagraph (b)
above to the contrary, the following shall govern the computation and
remittance of the "percentage payment" as that term is defined in
subparagraph (b) above:
- 75 -

--- PAGE 79 of 183 ---

(3) Domestic Pictures.
(i) If two or more individuals subject to the

days of principal photography on the motion picture occurred outside of
the following states – Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and
Wyoming. In the event that the IATSE determines that the proration

determining whether twenty-nine (29) or fewer individuals are employed
on the picture, the following shall be excluded: make-up artists,
hairdressers and costumers who are specifically required to be furnished

(2) A majority of the shooting days
of principal photography on the motion picture occurred outside of the
following states – Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho,

the first percentage payment is due to the Plans from Producer. Said
Application shall contain the following information: If the right to
prorate is based upon the provisions of subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(A)
above, the aggregate salaries paid to the Los Angeles production crew
and the aggregate salaries paid to the entire production crew; the number
of shooting days of principal photography occurring in the states listed
in subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) above; the total other shooting days and
the states in which said other shooting days occurred. If the right to
prorate is based upon the provisions of subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)
above, the number of individuals on the Los Angeles production crew;
the number of such individuals who were hired from the jurisdiction of
the IATSE West Coast Studio Locals; the number and job classifications
of those individuals excluded pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph
(c)(3)(iii)(B)(1) above; the aggregate salaries paid to the Los Angeles
production crew; the aggregate salaries paid to the entire production
crew; the number of shooting days of principal photography occurring in
the states listed in subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B)(2) above; the total other
shooting days and the states in which said other shooting days occurred.
If an Application to Prorate is submitted later than the dates specified
above, it will nonetheless be deemed granted if the identified picture
meets said criteria; provided, however, that, if he deems it necessary, the
Administrator of the Pension and Health Plans may require a Producer
submitting a late Application to Prorate to allow a special audit of the
percentage payments due and the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans shall be reimbursed by the Producer for all reasonable fees
- 79 -

--- PAGE 83 of 183 ---

and expenses incurred by the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
Health Plans in performing said audit.
(d) (1) Producer will furnish to the Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans written reports showing the
Producer's gross received from the sale, lease, license and distribution
(whether by Producer or a distributor) in Supplemental Markets of each
motion picture subject to the provisions of this Article. In the written
reports filed with the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans,
the Producer shall indicate whether it is prorating on each picture being
reported and, if so, what proration percentage is being applied and the
basis for the Producer's right to prorate -- i.e., whether proration is being
applied pursuant to subparagraph (c)(2) or pursuant to subparagraph
(c)(3)(iii)(A) or pursuant to subparagraph (c)(3)(iii)(B) above. Such
reports shall be furnished quarterly during each fiscal or calendar quarter
of the Producer. Concurrently with the furnishing of each such report,
the Producer will make the payments shown to be due by such report.
All required payments shall be made by check payable to the order of
and delivered to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans.
Each such quarterly statement shall designate the title of the motion
picture involved. On request, the Producer shall make available to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans all accounting
statements delivered by a distributor to the Producer, but only insofar as
such statements relate to the Producer's gross. The Motion Picture
Industry Pension and Health Plans shall have the right, at reasonable
times, to examine the books and records of Producer insofar as they
relate to the Producer's gross and -- as to any motion picture for which
Producer assumes as Buyer the obligation to make percentage payments
pursuant to subparagraph (b)(11) above -- the documents reflecting or
effectuating the purchase; provided that, with respect to these latter
documents, the Producer may require the persons examining them to
execute reasonable agreements to respect their confidentiality. Producer
shall not be required to furnish any quarterly statement hereunder with
respect to the motion picture prior to Producer's receipt of any Producer's
gross with respect to the motion picture, or for any annual period during
which no Producer's gross from the motion picture is received by the
Producer.
(2) For each motion picture produced by Producer on
which the Producer plans to prorate (whether proration is being applied
pursuant to subparagraph (c)(2) or pursuant to subparagraph (c)(3)
above) for three (3) years after either the date of the first annual report
showing a percentage payment on such motion picture or the receipt by
the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans of the Producer's
written request for audit of the percentage payments due, Producer shall
maintain and make available to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and
- 80 -

Health Plans and their auditors the following information: the names of
the employees on the Los Angeles production crew; the names of the
employees on the entire production crew; the names of all individuals
subject to the Basic Agreement working on the motion picture (whether
in pre-production, production or post-production functions); the names
of all individuals who were not subject to the Basic Agreement but who
worked on the motion picture in job categories referred to either in this
Basic Agreement or in the other collective bargaining agreements
between Producer and the West Coast Studio Locals or between
Producer and the unions referred to in subparagraph (e) below; the total
below-the-line labor costs of individuals subject to the Basic Agreement
(whether in pre-production, production or post-production functions);
and, the total below-the-line labor costs of all individuals working on the
motion picture in job categories referred to either in this Basic
Agreement or in the other collective bargaining agreements between
Producer and the West Coast Studio Locals or between Producer and the
unions referred to in subparagraph (e) below.
(3) As to any motion picture subject to subparagraph
(c) above for which Producer assumes the obligation to make percentage
payments pursuant to subparagraph (b)(11) above, if Producer wishes to
prorate its percentage payments for such motion picture, it shall obtain
the records provided for in subparagraph (d)(2) above from the producer
of such motion picture.
(e) The provisions of this Article XXVIII were negotiated
by the following unions for the benefit of the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans:
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees
and Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of
the United States, its Territories and Canada; Studio
Transportation Drivers, Local 399 of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters; Local 40 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; Local 724 of the
International Hod Carriers, Building and Common Laborers
Union; Local 755 of the Operative Plasterers and Cement
Masons International Association of United States and
Canada; and United Association of Journeymen and
Apprentices of the Plumbing and Piping Industry of United
States and Canada, Local 78.
Any reference in any other collective bargaining
agreement (whether with one of the above unions or any other union or
guild) to a "percentage payment to the Motion Picture Industry Pension
Plan and/or Motion Picture Industry Health Plan with respect to the
- 81 -

--- PAGE 85 of 183 ---

exhibition of motion pictures in Supplemental Markets" is and shall be
deemed to be a reference to the "percentage payment" as set forth in this
Article XXVIII, which amount is the only amount, in the aggregate,
which the Producer and all such unions have agreed upon for the benefit
of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans with respect to
the exhibition of motion pictures in Supplemental Markets.
The compliance by Producer with the conditions set
forth in this Article XXVIII likewise constitutes compliance as to all the
unions.
(f) The following provisions shall apply to "feature length
primarily animated motion pictures," as defined herein, produced by
Producer with employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement,18 which motion pictures for the first time are, either during
the term hereof or at any time thereafter, released in Supplemental
Markets, as defined in subparagraph (a)(3) above.
(1) Definition
A "feature length primarily animated motion
picture" refers to any motion picture produced for theatrical exhibition
which consists primarily or exclusively of animated footage and has a
continuous running time of more than thirty (30) minutes. Animated
motion pictures which include live action essential to the storyline (e.g.,
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?") are not primarily animated motion
pictures (but are instead covered under subparagraphs (a) through (e)
above and subparagraph (g) below if produced subject to an IATSE
Basic Agreement).
(2) Contributions Required
The contributions required to be made for release
of feature length primarily animated motion pictures in Supplemental
Markets are as follows:
(i) No contributions are required to be made on
any feature length primarily animated motion picture produced and/or
released prior to November 1, 1992.
18 Employees employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall not be considered "employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (f) of this Article XXVIII, except as indicated in the
footnote to subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(C)(1) and (f)(2)(v)(C)(2) below.
- 82 -

--- PAGE 86 of 183 ---

(ii) (A) With respect to those feature length
primarily animated motion pictures designated in subparagraph (B)
below, Producer shall make contributions based upon the following:
(1) for distribution in Supplemental
Markets other than by means of cassettes, two percent (2%) of "Producer's
gross," as that term is defined in subparagraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(3) above;
and
(2) for distribution in Supplemental
Markets by means of cassettes, 2.25% of "Producer's gross," as that term
is defined in subparagraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3) above, until the
Producer's gross equals one million dollars ($1,000,000) and, thereafter,
upon 2.75% of "Producer's gross."
(B) Subparagraph (ii)(A) above shall apply
only to the following feature length primarily animated motion pictures:
"Pagemaster;"
"Once Upon a Forest" aka "The
Endangered;"
"Puff the Magic Dragon;"
"We're Back;"
"Cats;" and
"Snowballs."
(iii) With respect to any feature length primarily
animated motion picture not covered under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
above, which has its initial theatrical release on or after November 1,
1992, and which is thereafter released in Supplemental Markets,
Producer shall make contributions based upon:
(A) for distribution in Supplemental
Markets other by means of cassettes, three and six-tenths percent (3.6%)
of "Producer's gross," as that term is defined in subparagraphs (b)(1)(ii)
and (b)(3) above; and
(B) for distribution in Supplemental
Markets by means of cassettes, four and five-tenths percent (4.5%) of
"Producer's gross," as that term is defined in subparagraphs (b)(2)(ii) and
(b)(3) above, until the Producer's gross equals one million dollars
($1,000,000) and, thereafter, upon five and four-tenths percent (5.4%) of
"Producer's gross."
(iv) The contributions required under
subparagraph (f)(2)(ii) and (iii) above shall be paid to the Motion Picture
- 83 -

--- PAGE 87 of 183 ---

Industry Pension and Health Plans. The parties shall have the right to
reallocate such contributions as provided in subparagraph (b)(4) above.
(v) The following provisions of subparagraphs
(a) through (e) and subparagraph (g) of Article XXVIII are applicable to
feature length primarily animated motion pictures covered under this
subparagraph (f):
(A) subparagraph (a)(3);
(B) subparagraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(2)(ii),
(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7), (b)(8), (b)(9), (b)(10), (b)(11) and
(b)(12);
(C) The proration provision set forth in
subparagraph (c) shall be modified to read as follows:
Notwithstanding any provision in
subparagraph (f)(2) above, the following shall govern the computation
and remittance of payment due for release of feature length primarily
animated motion pictures in Supplemental Markets:
(1) If a feature length primarily
animated motion picture is produced partially with employees employed
by Producer under this Agreement19 and partially with persons working
in job categories referred to in this Basic Agreement who are not
covered under this Agreement, the percentage payment required under
subparagraphs (f)(2)(ii) and (iii) above shall be prorated by multiplying
such percentage payment by a fraction whose numerator consists of the
sum of the total below-the-line labor costs of individuals subject to the
Basic Agreement working on the picture and the total below-the-line
labor costs of individuals subject to The Animation Guild, Local #839
Agreement, if any, (whether such individuals are employed in
production or post-production, but excluding distribution -- distribution,
for the purposes of this provision, shall include all laboratory work other
than that performed by employees charged directly to a picture) and
whose denominator consists of the sum of the total below-the-line labor
costs of all individuals working on the picture in job categories referred
19 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall be considered "individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" and
"employees employed by Producer under this Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (c) and
subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(C)(1) and (2) of this Article XXVIII only and for no other purpose.
Accordingly, when Producer is entitled to prorate hereunder, the salaries of all individuals
employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Amendment
Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room
Assistants shall be included in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction referred to
in subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(v)(C)(1) of this Article XXVIII.
- 84 -

--- PAGE 88 of 183 ---

to in this Basic Agreement and the total below-the-line labor costs of all
individuals working on the picture in job categories referred to in The
Animation Guild, Local #839 Agreement (whether in production or post-
production but excluding distribution -- distribution, for the purposes of
this provision, shall include all laboratory work other than that
performed by employees charged directly to a picture).
(2) "Individuals subject to the Basic
Agreement" and "employees employed by Producer under this
Agreement"20 include all persons working on the motion picture under
the terms of the Basic Agreement who are hired to perform services in
Los Angeles or hired in Los Angeles to perform services at a distant
location, whether hired by a Producer itself or employed indirectly by a
Producer through loan-outs, payroll companies or comparable
employing agents; provided, however, that individuals not specifically
charged to the motion picture or who are included in general overhead
and individuals such as projectionists and publicists engaged primarily
in off-location services during the production of the motion picture are
not included in either the numerator or denominator of the proration
fraction described above.
(3) As to any feature length
primarily animated motion picture on which the Producer intends to
make percentage payments on a prorated basis, an Application to Prorate
shall be delivered by the Producer to the Administrator of the Pension
and Health Plans on or before the date that the first percentage payment
is due to the Plans from Producer. Said Application shall contain the
following information: the aggregate salaries paid to those employees
employed by Producer under the Basic Agreement; if applicable, the
aggregate salaries paid to those employees employed by Producer
subject to The Animation Guild, Local #839 Agreement; the total
salaries paid to the entire production crew, including the salaries of
employees working in job categories referred to in the Local #839
Agreement; and the job classifications of those individuals excluded
because they perform distribution functions or because they are not
specifically charged to the motion picture or are not included in general
overhead or are engaged primarily in off-location services. If an
Application to Prorate is submitted later than the dates specified above,
20 Individuals employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall be considered "individuals subject to the Basic Agreement" and
"employees employed by Producer under this Agreement" for purposes of subparagraph (c) and
subparagraphs (f)(2)(v)(C)(1) and (2) of this Article XXVIII only and for no other purpose.
Accordingly, when Producer is entitled to prorate hereunder, the salaries of all individuals
employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Amendment
Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’ Room
Assistants shall be included in both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction referred to
in subparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (f)(2)(v)(C)(1) of this Article XXVIII.
- 85 -

--- PAGE 89 of 183 ---

it will nonetheless be deemed granted if the identified picture meets said
criteria; provided, however, that if he deems it necessary, the
Administrator of the Motion Picture and Industry Pension and Health
Plans may require a Producer submitting a late Application to Prorate to
allow a special audit of the percentage payments due and the Motion
Picture and Industry Pension and Health Plans shall be reimbursed by
the Producer for all reasonable fees and expenses incurred in performing
said audit.
(4) The provisions of subparagraph
(d) shall apply, except that conforming changes shall be made to
eliminate the references to the basis for the Producer's right to prorate
and in the language relating to the nature of the information to be
maintained and made available to the Motion Picture and Industry
Pension and Health Plans and their auditors.
(5) The provisions of subparagraph
(e) shall apply.
(D) The provisions of subparagraph (g)
shall apply.
(3) The parties acknowledge and agree that no
Supplemental Markets payments are due for the release in Supplemental
Markets of primarily animated motion pictures which do not meet the
definition of a "feature length primarily animated motion picture" in
subparagraph (f)(1) above. For example, no payments are due for the
release in Supplemental Markets of primarily animated motion pictures
produced for free television, pay television/videocassettes or basic cable.
(4) The parties hereto acknowledge that a resolution
of the obligations of Walt Disney Pictures & Television to make Post
'60s and Supplemental Markets payments on primarily animated feature
length motion pictures was reached with the IATSE and the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans in June of 1992. The terms of
that resolution are set forth in a Memorandum Agreement executed in
June of 1992. The terms of that Memorandum Agreement supplement
the provisions of this subparagraph (f); in the event of any inconsistency
between said provisions, the terms of the Disney Memorandum
Agreement shall control.
(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties hereby confirm the following understanding and practices of the
Producers with respect to the Supplemental Markets provisions:
- 86 -

--- PAGE 90 of 183 ---

(1) Article XXVIII does not require a percentage
payment to be made with respect to motion pictures on which the only
employees employed under the Basic Agreement performed post-
production (including editorial) work; and
(2) Article XXVIII does not require percentage
payments to be made with respect to motion pictures which are produced
by a producer which is not signatory to the Basic Agreement (and the
Basic Crafts Agreements).
(3) The Supplemental Markets provisions apply only
to motion pictures "produced by Producer with employees employed
under this Agreement."21 The parties have agreed that the quoted
language is satisfied only if two (2) or more employees are employed on
the production under either the IATSE Agreement or the Basic Crafts
Agreements. This requirement is not satisfied if there is only one
employee covered under the Basic Agreement and one employee
covered under the Basic Crafts Agreements.
(4) (i) The "Domestic Pictures" proration provision
of the Supplemental Markets clause provides that certain domestic
pictures are eligible for proration of Supplemental Markets payments if,
among other requirements, the Los Angeles production crew consists of
twenty-nine (29) or fewer individuals (no more than twenty-two (22) of
whom may be hired from the jurisdiction of the IATSE West Coast
Studio Locals). In determining whether either the "29 or fewer" or "22
or fewer" requirement has been met, employees who replace other
employees are not counted. For example, suppose there are seven (7)
persons on the crew who fall within the Los Angeles production crew
definition, including the Director of Photography. Suppose further that
the Director of Photography is replaced with another person hired from
the jurisdiction of Local #600. The replacement Director of
Photography would not be counted in figuring whether the "29 or fewer"
or "22 or fewer" standards were met.
However, the salary paid to any replacement
employee under these circumstances shall be included in both the
numerator and denominator.
(ii) Similarly, individuals hired from either the
jurisdiction of the IATSE West Coast Studio Local Unions or from the
jurisdiction of the Basic Crafts Unions who are replaced with another
21 Employees employed under the Local #600 Amendment Agreement or the Local #871
Amendment Agreement or the Local #871 Agreement covering Script Coordinators and Writers’
Room Assistants shall not be considered "employees employed under this Agreement" for
purposes of subparagraph (g)(3) of this Article XXVIII.
- 87 -

--- PAGE 91 of 183 ---

individual employed under the same West Coast Studio Local
Agreement or Basic Crafts Agreement, respectively, shall not be counted
in determining whether a motion picture has been produced by a
Producer with "employees" employed under this Agreement.
For example, if the only individual hired
from the jurisdiction of the West Coast Studio Local Unions and the
Basic Crafts Unions on a particular production is an Art Director, and
the Art Director is replaced on that production by another Art Director
hired from the jurisdiction of Local #800, there will still be only one (1)
employee hired from the jurisdiction of the IATSE on the production,
with the result that the Supplemental Markets clause is not applicable to
that production.
(h) If any other Union or Guild negotiates, as part of its
collective bargaining agreement with the AMPTP, residuals on product
for iPods or similar devices, the Producers will meet with the IATSE to
negotiate an appropriate residual formula.
XXVIIIA. Special Residual Formula for Theatrical Motion
Pictures Licensed to Free Television, Supplemental
Markets and/or New Media for which a Minimum
Guarantee or Non-Returnable Advance is Payable
Should a Producer enter into a license agreement on or after
August 1, 2015 with respect to theatrical motion pictures covered under
this Basic Agreement or under any prior Basic Agreement that requires
Post '60s or Supplemental Market payments, which license agreement
provides a minimum guarantee or non-returnable advance to the
Producer in exchange for theatrical distribution rights as well as
distribution rights of the theatrical motion picture in free television,
Supplemental Markets and/or New Media (hereinafter referred to as a
"qualifying transaction"), the provisions of Articles XIX and XXVIII
and the Sideletter re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via New
Media to this Agreement shall apply, except as provided below:
(a) The percentage payment to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans shall be four and one-half percent (4.5%) of
"Producer's gross" which, as used herein, means the total license fees
(including overage payments) received by the Producer in connection
with the qualifying transaction described above. (Subparagraph (3) of
Article XIX(b) shall not apply to such percentage payment.) Such
amount shall be in lieu of any percentage payment otherwise due to the
Plans under the Post '60s and Supplemental Markets provisions of this
Agreement (Articles XIX and XXVIII), or of any prior Basic
- 88 -

--- PAGE 92 of 183 ---

Agreement, and under the Sideletter re Exhibition of Motion Pictures
Transmitted Via New Media to this Agreement or any prior Basic
Agreement with respect to the market(s) included in such transaction
(i.e., it shall satisfy all residual payment obligations in connection with
all residual-bearing markets covered by the transaction).
(b) Of the total contribution due to the Plans under
subparagraph (a) above, thirty percent (30%) shall be allocated as
provided in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of Article XIX(b)(1), and
seventy (70%) shall be allocated as provided in subparagraphs (i)
through (v) of Article XXVIII(b)(4).
(c) Once during the term of each IATSE Basic Agreement
that succeeds the 2015 IATSE Basic Agreement, the parties will re-
examine the blended contribution rate set forth in subparagraph (a)
above.
(d) This Article XXVIIIA. shall not apply to feature length
primarily animated motion pictures.
XXIX. Studio Zone, Secondary Studio Zone, New York Thirty
(30) Mile Zone and Production Centers
(a) Studio Zone
Studio Zone Defined - The studio zone shall be the area
within a circle thirty (30) miles in radius from Beverly Boulevard and La
Cienega Boulevard, Los Angeles, California and includes Agua Dulce,
Castaic (including Lake Castaic), Leo Carillo State Beach, Ontario
International Airport, Piru and Pomona (including the Los Angeles
County Fair Grounds). The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., Conejo Ranch
property shall be considered as within the studio zone. (See Exhibit "Z"
attached.)
Work Time - Studio rates and working conditions shall
prevail for all work performed within the studio zone; however, for
newly-called employees and those employees notified on the previous
day prior to their departure from the studio (or the zone location) to
report at the zone location, work time shall begin and end at the zone
location; otherwise, work time shall begin and end at the studio, such
work time to include travel time both ways between the studio and the
zone location.
- 89 -

--- PAGE 93 of 183 ---

Transportation within the Studio Zone - Except as is
otherwise provided herein, with respect to work at any studio zone
location, Producer shall either furnish transportation to the employee or,
at its option, may require employee to report at such location, in which
case it will allow mileage of thirty cents (30¢) per mile computed
between the studio and zone location and return to be paid on the
employee's pay check that covers the payroll week in which the mileage
was incurred. Employee shall not be requested to transport other
employees or equipment (other than trade tools). The studio shall have
the right to require the employee to report (subject to the same mileage
allowance between the studio and the pick-up point) at a pick-up point
within the studio zone for subsequent transportation furnished by the
studio from such pick-up point to nearby location and return to the
pick-up point. Work at another studio is not a "zone location." The
IATSE will not unreasonably deny a request for waiver of the mileage
allowance for employees who report to a "zone location" which is a
regular place of employment for a production. As to theatrical motion
pictures only, the Producer shall not be required to pay a mileage
allowance to any employee reporting to a "zone location" within Los
Angeles County which is within a ten (10) mile radius from a point to be
designated by the Producer. Commencing outside the ten (10) mile
radius, a mileage allowance will be paid as provided above. Secured
parking will be provided at such locations as hereinafter required in this
provision.
Reporting Within the Zone - As to an employee
reporting to a designated site within the studio zone, if there are any
moves required in the studio zone from one location to another, or to a
nearby location, the employees will be transported to and from such
other location.
Parking Facilities - When an employee reports for work
within the studio zone other than at a studio, the Producer will pay for
parking in a supervised public parking lot. If no such public parking is
available, the Producer will provide supervised or secured parking.
Courtesy Housing - Upon request of an employee who
is required to work in excess of fourteen (14) hours in the studio zone
and who advises the Producer that he or she is too tired to drive home
safely, Producer shall provide the employee either courtesy housing or
round trip transportation from the designated crew parking area to home
and return at the Producer's expense. Producer shall have no
responsibility for the personal vehicle of an employee who elected to use
his or her personal vehicle in lieu of Producer-provided transportation.
- 90 -

--- PAGE 94 of 183 ---

Golden Hours - When this provision applies, if an
employee reports for work outside a studio and within the studio zone,
the "Golden Hour" pay rates will commence after twelve (12) elapsed
hours, except that on television productions, "Golden Hour" pay rates for
"on production" employees will commence after twelve (12) hours
worked.
Material Violations - If the Local Union involved
claims that a material violation of this provision is occurring with respect
to the employees covered by its Local collective bargaining agreement
with Producer, then:
(1) Such Local shall immediately notify the
designated representative of Producer, the IATSE, the AMPTP and
Contract Services Administration Trust Fund ("CSATF").
(2) Such Local Union and such representative of the
Producer shall immediately settle the dispute or determine whether or
not there is a material violation of this provision.
(3) In the event the Local Union and the Producer do
not settle the dispute or make such a determination as above provided,
then the IATSE, the AMPTP and CSATF must, within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of such notice of the alleged material violation,
determine whether or not there is such a material violation. Such a
determination shall be final and binding upon the parties and the
employees subject to such Local Union collective bargaining agreement
involved.
If it is so determined that there is such a material
violation, this studio zone provision (i) with respect to television films,
shall be suspended in respect to production of the television episode
involved; and (ii) with respect to a theatrical motion picture, shall be
suspended in respect to production of the theatrical picture involved for
a period of fifteen (15) calendar days following the determination that
there is such a material violation. Provided, however, Producer shall not
reschedule the shooting from the zone to the studio in order to avoid the
application of this provision.
(4) Alleged violations of this studio zone provision
shall not be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Procedure provided
in the Local Agreements.
- 91 -

--- PAGE 95 of 183 ---

(b) Secondary Studio Zone
(1) The secondary studio zone shall be the area
extending ten (10) miles from the perimeter of the studio zone and
including John Wayne Airport and the City of Huntington Beach in its
entirety. It does not include any of the areas that fall within the
definition of the studio zone in subparagraph (a) above.
(2) When an employee is directed to report to a
location within the secondary studio zone, the following shall apply:
(i) Producer shall notify employees not less
than twenty-four (24) hours in advance that it intends to require
employees to report to a location within the secondary studio zone.
Such notification shall not constitute a work call.
(ii) Mileage shall be paid from the studio or
production office to and from the location within the secondary studio
zone. In addition, the Producer shall pay a $4.50 per day allowance to
each employee asked to report within the secondary studio zone.
(iii) Courtesy housing shall be offered to those
employees who work in excess of twelve (12) hours in the secondary
studio zone. In the alternative, the Producer may provide round trip
transportation to home and return at the Producer's expense.
(iv) Rest periods shall be calculated from the
perimeter of the thirty (30) mile studio zone. A designated
representative of the Producer and a designated representative of the
IATSE shall determine the amount of time needed to travel between the
secondary studio zone location and the perimeter of the thirty (30) mile
studio zone for purposes of calculating rest periods. In the event of a
dispute, the matter shall be referred to a representative of the Union and
to the Labor Relations representative of the Producer for resolution.
(v) Except as otherwise provided in this
subparagraph (b), all of the other provisions applicable to an employee
reporting within the studio zone shall apply.
(c) The IATSE agrees to continue to grant waivers on the
same basis as it has in the past for locations that are outside the studio
zone and the secondary studio zone, such as Lake Hughes, Elizabeth
Lake and the Nikken Building in Irvine.

(d) Courtesy Housing and Transportation within New York
Thirty (30) Mile Zone and Production Centers
Upon request of an employee who is required to work
in excess of fourteen (14) hours within a radius of thirty (30) miles of
Columbus Circle in the New York metropolitan area or in a "Production
Center" (as defined below) and who advises the Producer that he/she is
too tired to drive home safely, Producer shall provide the employee
either courtesy housing or round trip transportation from the designated
crew parking area to home and return at the Producer's expense.22 The
Producer shall have no responsibility for the personal vehicle of an
employee who elected to use his or her personal vehicle in lieu of
Producer-provided transportation.
A "Production Center" means the area within a
thirty (30) mile radius of City Hall in: Anchorage, Alaska; Phoenix,
Arizona; Tuscon, Arizona; Sacramento, California; San Diego,
California; Denver, Colorado; Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Miami, Florida;
Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Honolulu, Hawaii; New Orleans,

any other place where a television pilot or series is based.
XXX. Sales Agreements
Producer will hereafter provide in its licensing agreements
that credits of a motion picture, when provided by the collective
bargaining agreement, shall not be changed or eliminated on theatrical or
television exhibition.
XXXI. Safety
(a) It is agreed by the parties that too great an emphasis
cannot be placed on the need to provide a safe working environment. In
that context, it shall be incumbent on each employer (herein referred to
as the Producer) to furnish employment and a place of employment
22 Round trip transportation may include public transportation if reasonable under the
circumstances.
- 93 -

--- PAGE 97 of 183 ---

which are safe and healthful for the employees therein; to furnish and
use safety devices and safeguards, and adopt and use practices, means,
methods, operations and processes which are reasonably adequate to
render such employment and place of employment safe and healthful; to
do every other thing reasonably necessary to protect the life, safety and
health of employees. Correspondingly, no employer shall require or
permit any employee to go or be in any employment or place of
employment which is not safe and healthful. In addition, every
employer and every employee shall comply with occupational safety and
health standards and all rules, regulations and orders pursuant to
applicable laws which are applicable to his/her own actions and conduct;
no person (employer or employee) shall remove, displace, damage,
destroy or carry off any safety device, safeguard, notice or warning,
furnished for the use in any employment or place of employment; no
person shall interfere with the use of any method or process adopted for
the protection of any employee, including his/herself, in such
employment or place of employment.
(b) Rigid observance of safety regulations must be adhered
to and willful failure of any employee to follow safety rules and
regulations can lead to disciplinary action including discharge; however,
no employee shall be discharged or otherwise disciplined for refusing to
work on a job that exposes the individual to a clear and present danger to
life or limb, or for making a good faith report to the First Assistant
Director, the Unit Production Manager or his or her supervisor relating
to the safety of another employee exposed to a clear and present danger
of life or limb. No set of safety regulations, however, can
comprehensively cover all possible unsafe practices of working. The
Producer and the Union therefore undertake to promote in every way
possible the realization of the responsibility of the individual employee
with regard to preventing accidents to himself or his fellow employees.
For purposes of this Article XXXI.(b), the question of whether an
employee has made a report in good faith is subject to the grievance and
arbitration procedure set forth in Article XXXII of this Agreement.
(c) It is also agreed that when unresolved or continuing
disputes exist regarding Safety and Health compliance, noncompliance
or interpretation therein of Title 8, Chapter 4, Subchapter 7, General
Industry Safety Orders, said disputes shall be referred to the Alliance of
Motion Picture and Television Producers and CSATF-administered
Labor Management Safety Committee for review, investigation,
interpretation and advisory recommendations to the Employer(s). The
CSATF-administered Labor Management Safety Committee is the
industry-wide Safety Committee consisting of the IATSE and its West
Coast Studio Local Unions, the Basic Crafts Unions, the Screen Actors
Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the
- 94 -

--- PAGE 98 of 183 ---

Directors Guild of America and representatives of the Producers. It is
understood that it is not the responsibility of the Safety Committee, or
any member of the Committee, the IATSE or its Local Unions, the Basic
Crafts, CSATF or the AMPTP to implement or comply with any such
recommendations.
(d) The Labor Management Safety Committee shall meet at
least once a month.
(e) The cost of the Labor Management Committee will be
borne by the Contract Services Administration Trust Fund.
(f) A separate bulletin shall be issued by the AMPTP to
provide the following:
(1) The Producers reaffirm their commitment to
regularly inspect the studio working areas and to establish preventive
maintenance procedures to assure safe working conditions.
(2) Complaints of unsafe conditions will be promptly
investigated by the Producer and appropriate action will be taken if the
Producer finds that an unsafe condition does exist.
(3) Each Producer will designate an individual as the
responsible safety officer for its respective studio, facility, laboratory or
location site. Except on location, each safety officer will have a well-
publicized "hot-line" phone number which employees can anonymously
call to alert management to any existing safety problems which may
require correction.
(4) The Producers will provide access to all working
areas to the Safety Director of CSATF so that he will periodically
inspect same.
(5) Communication regarding safety policy will be
made available to all affected employees directly or by posting on
bulletin boards.
(g) Concerns stemming from the use of smoke on sets shall
be referred to the industry-wide Safety Committee for resolution.
(h) The parties agree to submit to the CSATF Safety Action
Team, for its consideration during the term of the Agreement, the
addition of Automatic External Defibrillator ("A.E.D.") training to the
Safety Pass Program curriculum and to discuss the circumstances under
- 95 -

--- PAGE 99 of 183 ---

which a medic should be provided with an A.E.D. when working on
location.
XXXIA. Safety Training
A four (4) hour minimum call shall apply for any day on
which an employee, at the request of an individual Producer, reports for
safety training.
XXXII. Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
The grievance and arbitration procedure provisions in
Agreements now in effect between the Producers, on the one hand, and
the IATSE and its respective West Coast Studio Locals, on the other
hand, shall be amended in their entirety as set forth below, effective
August 1, 2018:
In the event of any dispute between the Local Union or any
of the persons subject to this Agreement and the Producer with regard to
wage scales, hours of employment or working conditions or with regard
to the interpretation of this Agreement concerning such provisions, the
procedure, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, shall be as
follows:
Step One - The aggrieved party shall mail or deliver to the other
party a written notice of the claim and concurrently furnish a copy of
such notice to the International Representative of the IATSE and
Contract Services Administration Trust Fund. Such written notice shall
contain the specific contract sections which are alleged to have been
violated, the dates(s) or approximate date(s) of the alleged violation(s),
the facts on which the grievance is based, the name of the production (if
any), the remedy sought and the names of the individuals aggrieved,
when known, except for group claims for which the classifications of the
individuals aggrieved, when known, shall be listed.
A claim by the Local Union that the confirmation regarding
guarantees of employment set forth in Paragraph 6 of the West Coast
Studio Local Agreements has been violated by a Producer may be filed
only upon the written approval of the West Coast Office of the
International Union. Such written approval shall accompany the claim.
The party which has received the grievance shall, within fifteen
(15) working days after the grievance has been received, respond in
writing to the aggrieved party, setting forth the reasons, if any, for the
- 96 -

--- PAGE 100 of 183 ---

action(s) taken by it, which action(s) gave rise to the grievance. Copies
of such written response shall also be furnished to the same parties
served with the grievance. The representative of the Local Union and
the designated representative of Producer shall immediately discuss the
matter and the grievance shall be settled if at all possible. The decision,
if any, of such representatives shall be final and binding upon the parties
and any employees concerned.
If the party receiving the grievance fails to serve the written
response as required by Step One, then the other party may elect to
proceed directly to arbitration or to Step 2 by serving a written demand
upon the other party within five (5) working days after the written
response was due.
Conciliation Committee
Step Two - If, within ten (10) working days after the response has
been served, the parties fail to meet, or if the grievance is not settled,
then the aggrieved party may proceed to Step Two, by delivering or
mailing, within five working days thereafter, a written demand, which
shall include a statement of the particulars of the claim, upon the other
party and upon the International Representative of the IATSE and
CSATF. If neither party requests a Step Two conciliation meeting, then
the aggrieved party may proceed directly to Step Three regarding
expedited or regular arbitration, by serving a written demand upon the
other party within the time periods set forth above. Failure of the
aggrieved party to so serve such demand for a Step Two conciliation
meeting or an arbitration shall constitute a waiver of the claim, unless
the parties mutually stipulate otherwise in Step One.
If a demand for Step 2 is so served, the grievance shall be brought
before the Conciliation Committee as soon as practicable, but not later
than twenty (20) working days following the receipt of such notice. The
Conciliation Committee shall consist of an International Representative
of the IATSE and a representative of CSATF. In a grievance involving
an employer engaged exclusively in the operation of film processing
laboratories and Local #700 (formerly Local #683) on behalf of
employees of such laboratories, the provisions of the Step Two
conciliation meeting shall be as set forth in the Producer - I.A.T.S.E. and
M.P.T.A.A.C. Laboratory Film/Video Technicians and Cinetechnicians,
Local #700 Agreement.
The parties to the grievance shall be present and shall be
responsible for the presentation of their own position at such time and
place. If the aggrieved party fails to appear, then the grievance shall be
considered as waived. If the responding party fails to appear, then the
- 97 -

--- PAGE 101 of 183 ---

aggrieved party shall be entitled to proceed with the presentation of its
position, and the Conciliation Committee, upon presentation of evidence
showing a contract violation, shall have the authority to and shall issue
an immediate final and binding award in favor of the aggrieved party,
including an appropriate remedy.
If either party intends to appear, but does not intend to present any
facts or arguments as to a defense or as to the claim, then such party
shall so notify the other party as to such intention at least three (3) days
prior to the conciliation meeting. In any event, either party may, at least
three (3) days prior to the date of the Conciliation Committee meeting,
cancel such Conciliation Committee meeting and the aggrieved party
may proceed directly to arbitration under Step Three.
The AMPTP and the IATSE shall adopt written rules and
procedures which shall be designed to foster to the maximum extent
possible the exploratory and conciliatory nature of Step Two of this
procedure.
The Conciliation Committee shall, at the beginning of the meeting,
assist the parties in a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute. In the
event the parties, identified as the Producer and the Union, are able to
resolve the grievance with the assistance of the Conciliation Committee,
the Conciliation Committee shall reduce the resolution of the grievance
to writing as a binding determination on all parties. Such a
determination shall be signed by the parties.
If the dispute is not resolved as provided above, then both parties
at that time must declare whether they will be bound by a decision of the
Conciliation Committee. If both parties agree to be bound, then the
Conciliation Committee shall hear the evidence and arguments of the
parties and shall render a decision, which may include a "no decision"
award, which shall be final and binding on all the parties, including any
individual grievant. Disputes involving jurisdiction or technological
changes shall be specifically excluded from the jurisdiction of the
Conciliation Committee.
The Conciliation Committee shall have the right, upon written
request of either party, to refer the dispute back to the parties, without
prejudice to the merits and without expanding the time limits for the
filing of a grievance or a response, if the Conciliation Committee is of
the opinion that either the written grievance or response does not meet
the requirements set forth in Step One.
- 98 -

--- PAGE 102 of 183 ---

Step Three - If the parties do not agree that the Conciliation
Committee's recommendation will be final and binding on them or if the
parties fail to resolve the grievance, or if the Conciliation Committee has
issued a "no decision" award, then the parties may proceed to expedited
arbitration or regular arbitration as provided below:
(a) Expedited Arbitration - The aggrieved party may elect
to proceed to expedited arbitration within ten (10) working days
following the Step Two meeting, or within ten (10) working days
following the cancellation of the Step Two meeting, but only in cases
wherein the claim arises under Paragraph 68 involving disputes relating
to the failure to follow studio seniority or industry seniority, and
disputes arising under Paragraph 68 covering the discharge or discipline
for cause of an employee subject to Paragraph 68 of the applicable West
Coast Studio Local Agreements, or in cases wherein the claim for wage
payments, adjustments and/or damages consistent with the contract does
not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). The aggrieved party may
likewise proceed to expedited arbitration following Step Two over
disputes with regard to only "WAGE SCALES, HOURS OF
EMPLOYMENT, AND WORKING CONDITIONS" provision of the
Agreement subject to this Article and provided the claim for damages
does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000). Any other case may
be submitted to expedited arbitration only by the mutual agreement of
the parties.
In an arbitration involving an employer engaged
exclusively in the operation of film processing laboratories and Local
#700 (formerly Local #683) on behalf of employees of such laboratories,
the expedited arbitration procedure under Step Three will be as set forth
in the Producer - I.A.T.S.E. and M.P.T.A.A.C. Laboratory Film/Video
Technicians and Cinetechnicians, Local #700 Agreement.
Disputes involving jurisdiction or technological
changes shall be specifically excluded from the jurisdiction of expedited
arbitration.
Except as time limits are set forth in Paragraph 68,
cases that are submitted to expedited arbitration shall be heard within ten
(10) working days after the other party received the demand for
expedited arbitration or within ten (10) working days after the other
party gives notice of its agreement to proceed to expedited arbitration in
cases where the mutual agreement of the parties is required.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers and the IATSE shall revise the list of arbitrators assigned to
hear expedited arbitrations. The list shall consist of four (4) arbitrators
- 99 -

--- PAGE 103 of 183 ---

and two (2) alternates with recognized experience as professional labor
arbitrators.
During the term of this Agreement, the parties may
mutually add the names of additional persons to the panel of neutral
arbitrators to either supplement the panel or replace persons no longer
available to serve.
From the panel of names of the neutral arbitrators set
forth above, the arbitrators shall be assigned, depending upon their
availability, in rotation, to the cases as they arise. The parties may, by
mutual consent, select an arbitrator out of rotation provided that notice
of their selection is given to CSATF prior to the appointment of the
arbitrator next in rotation.
The expedited arbitration hearing shall be presided over
by a neutral arbitrator assigned from the panel of neutral arbitrators. The
IATSE and CSATF shall schedule the grievances to be heard in order of
receipt. The grievances must be heard by the assigned arbitrator unless
that individual becomes unavailable, in which instance the next
arbitrator in the rotation shall hear the grievance. If either party intends
to be represented by outside counsel at the expedited arbitration hearing,
then such party must notify the opposing party within two (2) working
days after the hearing date for the expedited arbitration has been
determined. The parties, who may be represented by outside counsel,
will not file post-hearing briefs, but may, prior to or during the hearing,
present a written statement of the facts. If either party so desires, a
stenographic record may be made and that party shall pay for the
transcript. In such cases, the transcript shall be solely for the use of the
party requesting it and shall not be used to delay a decision in the matter.
The two preceding sentences shall not apply to roster placement nor
roster removal arbitrations, for which no stenographic record shall be
made. The neutral arbitrator shall have sole authority to rule on all
motions and decide the case.
The writing of an opinion will be at the discretion of the
neutral arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrator, which shall be issued
orally and confirmed in writing if requested by either party at the
conclusion of the hearing, or in writing within three (3) days from the
conclusion of the hearing (the choice being at the sole discretion of the
arbitrator) shall be final and binding upon the parties and any employees
concerned. The neutral arbitrator shall have the power to determine only
the specific grievance or dispute and, when appropriate, award wage
adjustments or damages consistent with the contract, in an amount not to
exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), but shall not have the power
to amend, modify or effect a change in any of the provisions of this
- 100 -

--- PAGE 104 of 183 ---

Agreement, nor to determine jurisdictional or technological change
disputes. The decision of the neutral arbitrator shall be non-precedential
and his decision and/or opinion, if any, shall not be offered or admitted
into evidence in any other proceeding other than: (1) a judicial action
seeking confirmation, correction or vacation of said decision; or (2) a
grievance or arbitration proceeding involving the same Producer and
Local Union.
Fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne
equally by the parties to the dispute. All other costs shall be borne by
the party incurring the same.
The bills of the arbitrator, together with a completed
information form, shall be sent by the arbitrator to the IATSE and the
Producer involved in the expedited arbitration with copies to CSATF.
The information form shall be jointly prepared by the IATSE and
CSATF.
The neutral arbitrator shall proceed to hear a dispute
properly before him under this provision of expedited arbitration,
notwithstanding the fact that a similar case may be pending in a regular
arbitration.
(b) Regular Arbitration - The aggrieved party may elect to
proceed to regular arbitration within ten (10) working days following the
Step Two meeting or within ten (10) working days following the
cancellation of the Step Two meeting.
The IATSE and the Producers agree to establish a panel
of individuals with recognized experience as professional labor
arbitrators as members of a standing panel of neutral arbitrators. The
panel shall comprise an odd number of arbitrators.
If demand is served for regular arbitration, then the
parties shall select a sole arbitrator to hear and determine the grievance
by mutual agreement. If the parties cannot agree to the arbitrator to be
appointed, then each party shall have the right to alternately strike an
arbitrator's name from the panel until such time as one arbitrator is left
and the remaining arbitrator shall be selected and appointed as the
arbitrator in the proceedings.
The parties shall select the arbitrator within five (5)
working days after the demand for regular arbitration has been served.
The parties may, by mutual agreement, select the arbitrator outside of the
panel of neutral arbitrators or utilize the list of arbitrators obtained from
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
- 101 -

--- PAGE 105 of 183 ---

Such hearing shall be held within fourteen (14) days
after the arbitrator is selected, at such time and place as the arbitrator
shall determine. If the arbitrator so selected is unable or unwilling to
undertake the arbitration within the time limit herein provided, another
arbitrator shall be selected from such list. The decision of the arbitrator
shall be rendered in writing, stating his reasons for the award, within
thirty (30) days after the submission of the grievance for decision. The
arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding upon the parties thereto
and upon any employees concerned. The arbitrator shall have the power
to determine the specific grievance or dispute, but shall not have the
power to amend, modify or effect a change in any of the provisions of
the Agreement, nor to determine jurisdictional disputes.
Fees and expenses of the arbitrator and cost of a court
reporter and original transcript, when jointly requested, shall be borne
equally by the parties to the dispute; otherwise, the party making such
request shall pay for it. All other costs shall be borne by the party
incurring same.
(c) Claims - Any claims for the payment of wages or
severance pay, not presented under Step One within three hundred sixty-
five (365) consecutive days after the employee is entitled to such wages
or severance pay, shall be deemed to be waived. Any dispute as to the
correct amount of payment of holiday or vacation pay, not presented
under Step One within three hundred sixty-five (365) consecutive days
after March 15 of the calendar year next following the calendar year in
which such holiday or vacation pay, as the case may be, was earned,
shall be deemed to be waived.
Any other claim or grievance not presented under Step
One, within (i) sixty (60) calendar days after the occurrence of the
subject matter of the grievance or (ii) within sixty (60) calendar days
after the employee or the Union has had a reasonable opportunity to
become aware of the occurrence, whichever of (i) or (ii) is the later (but
in any event not to exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days
after the occurrence), shall be deemed to be waived. Time on distant
location shall not be included in this period.
For the purpose of this Article, "aggrieved party" shall
mean the Producer or the Union acting on its own behalf or on the behalf
of an employee covered by this Agreement.
(d) In General - The time periods provided for herein may
be extended by mutual written consent of the parties.
- 102 -

--- PAGE 106 of 183 ---

(e) Scheduling - In scheduling any grievance in Step Two
or Step Three, preference shall be given to any grievance involving the
discharge of an employee or a grievance involving the Industry
Experience Roster.
(f) Disciplinary Memos - Disciplinary memos issued to an
employee are admissible evidence in a grievance and/or arbitration
proceeding. However, such disciplinary memoranda, other than those
resulting in a suspension or discharge, issued more than two (2) years
prior to the incident or events giving rise to said grievance shall not be
admissible.
(g) An arbitration award issued in either expedited or
regular arbitration proceedings or a final and binding award rendered in
Step Two of the grievance procedure which requires the payment of a
specific sum of money shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the date of
the award. If payment is not made within said period, interest shall
accrue on the sum(s) due from the date of the award at the rate of one
percent (1%) per month.
If a calculation is required to determine the specific
amount(s) due under the award, the Producer shall calculate such
amount(s) and shall notify the other party of the specific sum(s) due
within sixty (60) days of the date of the award. If such calculation is not
made or if notice is not given as required, interest shall accrue on the
sum(s) due from the date of the award at a rate of one percent (1%) per
month. If, after calculation, the parties disagree on the sum(s) due, or if
the amount(s) due and owing under the award cannot be calculated
within the sixty-day period as a result of factors beyond the control of
the Producer, then no interest shall accrue upon the sum(s) due.
XXXIII. Employee Assistance Program for Drug and Alcohol
Abuse
The Producers endorse the concept of the IATSE and Basic
Crafts for providing an employee assistance program for drug and
alcohol abuse problems. Recognizing that such a program is best
administered under the auspices of the Motion Picture Industry Health
Plan, the Producers, in conjunction with the IATSE and Basic Crafts,
hereby recommend to the Board of Directors of the Motion Picture
Industry Health Plan that such an employee assistance program be added
to the benefits provided by the Health Plan. The Producers and the
Union agree that among the resources to be considered by the Health
Fund Directors in implementing this program is the existing program of
- 103 -

--- PAGE 107 of 183 ---

the Motion Picture and Television Fund, Alcoholics Anonymous and
Narcotics Anonymous.
An employee who has an alcohol or drug abuse problem
which interferes with job performance or attendance will be disciplined
in accordance with normal disciplinary procedures. In such cases,
before an employee is discharged or disciplinary action is taken, the
Producer will give advance notice to the applicable Local Union and will
meet or confer with such Local Union representative. As a part of those
procedures or as an alternative thereto, such an employee may be
referred to counseling through a qualified employee assistance program.
Any employee who refuses to accept treatment through such a program
or who is again disciplined or discharged pursuant to this subsection by
his/her employer for unsatisfactory job performance or other misconduct
arising out of or resulting from drug or alcohol abuse shall not be
entitled to have the second or subsequent disciplinary action(s) reviewed
pursuant to the grievance and arbitration procedure. Notwithstanding
the participation by any employee in an employee assistance program
created pursuant to this Agreement, the Producers and the IATSE, its
Local Unions and the Basic Crafts recognize that each employee is and
remains responsible for his/her own satisfactory job performance.
XXXIV. Loan-outs
The Producer may utilize the services of an employee on a
loan-out basis for work covered by the Basic Agreement, the Videotape
Agreement and the West Coast Studio Local Agreements (Applicable
Agreements) under the following conditions:
(a) All seniority rights and terms of the Industry
Experience Roster of the Basic Agreement and Paragraph 68 of the
Local Agreements shall be fully applicable to the use of the services of
the employee on loan-out.
(b) With respect to compensation and conditions under the
Applicable Agreements, the Producer shall provide at least the minimum
compensation and conditions under the Applicable Agreements to the
loan-out company, but shall not be responsible for payment by the loan-
out company to its employee.
(c) Any claims or disputes between the employee on loan-
out and the Producer regarding salaries or terms and conditions of
employment that would be covered by the grievance and arbitration
provisions of the Applicable Agreements if the employee had been hired
directly by the Producer shall be subject to such grievance and
- 104 -

--- PAGE 108 of 183 ---

arbitration provisions with the right of the IATSE and the Local Unions
to file grievances on behalf of employee on loan-out.
(d) With respect to pension and health and contract services
administration, during such time as an employee is engaged by a
borrowing Producer through the employee's loan-out company, the
borrowing Producer shall make pension and health and CSATF
contributions directly to the Motion Picture Industry Health Plan and the
Motion Picture Industry Pension Plan on behalf of the employee so
employed based upon hours worked or guaranteed, whichever is greater.
Contributions may not be made by loan-out companies.
(e) A Producer who borrows an employee from a loan-out
company under this section, whose employment if directly by the
Producer would have been covered by the Applicable Agreements, shall,
within ten (10) days after the execution of the agreement covering the
loan-out transaction, give the IATSE a written notice of the transaction
including the names of the loan-out company and the employee loaned
out to the Producer. An inadvertent failure by the Producer to give such
notice shall not be deemed to be a breach of the Applicable Agreements.
"Loan-out company" for purposes of this Article is defined as
a company controlled by the loaned out employee, who is the only
employee of the loan-out company who performs work covered by the
Applicable Agreements.
XXXV. Employer in Default
The IATSE, the Basic Crafts and the AMPTP agree to
develop procedures designed to preclude employers who are in default
on wage payments and/or trust fund contributions and who cease
business from returning to the industry without curing the default(s).
XXXVI. Principle of Assistance
The IATSE and its West Coast Studio Locals hereby reaffirm
the past practice of assistance in the performance of bargaining unit
work among and between the various crafts and classifications of
employees in said unit. The IATSE will notify its members that this
principle of assistance is so reaffirmed and recognized. This principle is
reaffirmed by both parties for the objective of encouraging the
continuation and establishment of motion picture production under the
IATSE Basic Agreement in Los Angeles County, California.
- 105 -

--- PAGE 109 of 183 ---

XXXVII. Designating Responsible Employer
The IATSE, the Basic Crafts and the AMPTP agree to
develop a procedure to be used whenever more than one employer
is involved in the production of a motion picture covered by
this Agreement for designating the employer responsible for compliance
with the obligations set forth in the various Local Agreements.
XXXVIII. Parking and Transportation
Issues relating to parking shall be referred to the IATSE-
AMPTP Annual Meetings.
XXXIX. Cancellation of Calls/Fractional Payroll Weeks
Committee
A committee shall be formulated with the object of
standardizing, to the extent possible, the contract provisions in the West
Coast Studio Local Agreements governing cancellation of calls and
fractional payroll weeks.
XL. Payroll Companies
The terms and conditions of the IATSE Payroll Companies'
Memorandum Agreement (which are attached hereto as Exhibit "A")
shall apply to payroll companies who are bound or signatory to
this Basic Agreement.
XLI. Child Care Centers
The IATSE and the AMPTP shall address the issue of
establishing child care centers with individual employers on a Company-
by-Company basis.
XLII. Change of Name by Producer
If the signatory Producer intends to change its name, written
notice of the proposed changes shall be promptly given to the IATSE.
- 106 -

--- PAGE 110 of 183 ---

XLIII. Low Budget Features
The IATSE shall give good faith consideration on a case-by-
case basis to requests for special conditions for low budget features
committed to be produced in Los Angeles or with a Los Angeles-based
crew.
XLIV. Guarantees of Employment
The parties hereby confirm the following: The guaranteed
length of employment shall be daily or weekly. A guarantee for a longer
term shall be specifically set forth in writing. An employee may be
replaced following completion of the guaranteed period of employment.
XLV. Payroll Deposit
In order to secure performance of the Producer's payroll
obligations under the Basic Agreement, the Videotape Agreement and
the West Coast Studio Local Agreements, the parties agree as follows:
(a) In the event that a Producer (1) has filed for bankruptcy
protection or had a trustee/receiver appointed to handle its affairs within
five (5) years prior to the commencement of principal photography on a
given production; (2) has no prior history with the IATSE; or (3) fails to
make payroll in a given payroll period, the IATSE may require such
Producer to deposit with a payroll company of the Producer's choosing
an amount equal to two (2) weeks of estimated payroll plus two (2)
weeks of pension, health and IAP contributions for covered employees.
Such amount shall be used solely for the purpose of satisfying amounts
owed to covered employees and/or benefit plan(s), as applicable, under
this Basic Agreement, the Videotape Agreement and the West Coast
Studio Local Agreements.
(b) The Producer shall provide the IATSE with written
verification of the payroll company's consent to hold the deposit, which
must be executed by the payroll company.
(c) No later than four (4) weeks after the completion of
principal photography for the production, the IATSE shall advise the
Producer of any outstanding payroll obligations to the employees
employed on the production and/or the respective benefit plan(s). Upon
the expiration of such four (4) week period, the payroll company, with
the approval of the IATSE, shall remit the amounts due for any
undisputed items to the employee(s) to whom and/or benefit plan(s) to
- 107 -

--- PAGE 111 of 183 ---

which such amounts are due and shall remit the balance of the deposit to
the Producer, less (1) an amount sufficient to pay the disputed payroll
items, if any, and (2) an amount equal to two (2) weeks of estimated
payroll, plus two (2) weeks of pension, health and IAP contributions, for
post-production employees who remain on the payroll of the production,
which amounts shall remain deposited with the payroll company.
(d) No later than four (4) weeks after delivery of the final
answer print, the IATSE shall advise the Producer of any outstanding
payroll obligations to the post-production employees employed on the
production and/or the respective benefit plan(s). Upon the expiration of
such four (4) week period, the payroll company, with the approval of the
IATSE, shall remit the amounts due for any undisputed items to the
employee(s) to whom and/or benefit plan(s) to which such amounts are
due and shall remit the balance of the deposit to the Producer, less an
amount sufficient to pay the disputed payroll items, if any.
(e) Any amounts relating to disputed wage claims plus
pension, health and IAP contributions thereon shall remain deposited
with the payroll company pending the settlement or resolution pursuant
to Article 7 of the applicable Local Agreement of claims relating thereto.
For purposes of any arbitration hereunder, the arbitrator shall have the
power to determine only claims relating to the payment of wages and
benefit contributions thereon.
(f) The foregoing shall not apply (1) to a Producer
signatory to the Basic Agreement which, together with its related or
affiliated entities, has made Supplemental Markets payments to the
Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans in an aggregate
amount of not less than fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) (or has
made Post '60s payments of not less than six million dollars
($6,000,000)) during the three (3) year period beginning January 1, 1994
and ending on December 31, 1996, or in any subsequent three (3)
consecutive year period, or (2) to any of its related or affiliated entities.
(g) In lieu of making a deposit as required above, a
signatory producer may obtain and provide to the IATSE a letter of
guarantee from any commercial financial institution or from a Producer,
or its related or affiliated entities, that meets the requirements of
subparagraph (f) above, stating that it unconditionally guarantees the
fulfillment of payroll obligations and benefit contributions due
employees under the Basic Agreement with respect to a particular
motion picture.
(h) In the event that an Employer fails to make a required
deposit as set forth herein, the IATSE may direct the covered employees
- 108 -

--- PAGE 112 of 183 ---

to withhold services from that Producer on the production for which the
deposit is sought until the deposit is made or a letter of guarantee is
provided as set forth in subparagraph (g) above.
XLVI. California Sick Leave
(a) Accrual. Commencing July 1, 2015, eligible employees
covered by the IATSE Basic Agreement shall accrue one (1) hour of
paid sick leave for every thirty (30) hours worked in California for
Producer, up to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours or six (6) days. (In
lieu of the foregoing hourly accrual of paid sick leave, and provided that
advance notice is given to the employee, a Producer may elect to provide
employees, upon their eligibility to use sick leave as provided below
(i.e., upon working thirty (30) days in California for the Producer and
after their ninetieth (90th) day of employment in California with the
Producer (based on days worked or guaranteed), with a bank of twenty-
four (24) hours or three (3) days of sick leave per year, such year to be
measured, as designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year or
starting from the employee's anniversary date. Under this elected option,
such banked sick leave days may not be carried over to the following
year.)
(b) To be eligible to accrue paid sick leave, the employee
must have worked for the Producer for at least thirty (30) days in
California within a one (1) year period, such year to be measured, as
designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year or starting from the
employee's anniversary date. Sick leave may be used in minimum
increments of four (4) hours upon oral or written request after the
eligible employee has been employed by the Producer in California for
ninety (90) days (based on days worked or guaranteed), such period to
be measured, as designated by the Producer, as either a calendar year or
starting from the employee's anniversary date. Reasonable advance
notification of the need for sick leave is required if the use is
foreseeable; otherwise, notice is required as soon as practicable. Sick
days accrued on an hourly basis shall carry over to the following year of
employment; however, the Producer may limit the use of such accrued
time to no more than twenty-four (24) hours or three (3) days during
each year of employment as defined by the Employer in advance.
(c) For employees employed on an hourly or daily basis, a
day of sick leave pay shall be equal to eight (8) hours' pay at the
employee's straight time hourly rate. If a four (4) hour increment of sick
leave is taken, the employee shall be paid four (4) hours of pay at his
straight time hourly rate. For weekly employees (including "on call"
employees), a day of sick leave pay shall be equal to one-fifth (1/5th) of
- 109 -

--- PAGE 113 of 183 ---

the employee's weekly rate under the studio minimum wage scales or
one-sixth (1/6th) of the employee's weekly rate under the distant location
minimum wage scales (or fifty percent (50%) thereof for a four (4) hour
increment of sick leave taken). Replacements for weekly employees
(including "on call" employees) may be hired on a pro rata basis of the
weekly rate regardless of any contrary provision in this Agreement. The
employee shall not be required to find a replacement as a condition of
exercising his right to paid sick leave.
(d) Sick leave may be taken for the diagnosis, care or
treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, the
employee or the employee's "family member."23 Sick leave also may be
taken by an employee who is a victim of domestic violence, sexual
assault or stalking.
(e) Accrued, unused sick leave is not paid out on termination,
resignation or other separation from employment. If an employee is
rehired by the Producer within one (1) year of the employee's separation
from employment, the employee's accrued and unused sick leave shall be
reinstated, and the employee may begin using the accrued sick leave upon
rehire if the employee was previously eligible to use the sick leave or once
the employee becomes eligible as provided above.
(f) Producer shall include in the employee's start
paperwork the contact information for the designated Producer
representative whom the employee may contact to confirm eligibility and
the amount of accrued sick leave available. Such start paperwork shall
also include information with respect to the year period (i.e., calendar
year or the employee's anniversary date) that the Producer selected to
measure the thirty (30) day and ninety (90) day eligibility periods and
the cap on accrual set forth in subparagraph (b) above or, alternatively, if
the Producer elected to provide employees with a sick leave bank, the
year period (i.e., calendar year or the employee's anniversary date) that
the Producer selected for the bank of three (3) sick days as provided in
subparagraph (a) above. Producer also shall notify the West Coast office
of the IATSE of the name and contact information of the designated
Producer representative.
(g) Any Producer that has a sick leave policy, or paid leave
or paid time off policy that permits the use of paid sick time, as of June
30, 2015, may continue such policy in lieu of the foregoing. Nothing
23 "Family member" means any of the following: (1) a biological, adopted or foster child,
stepchild, legal ward or a child to whom the employee stands in loco parentis; (2) a biological,
adoptive or foster parent, stepparent or legal guardian of the employee or the employee’s spouse
or registered domestic partner or a person who stood in loco parentis when the employee was a
minor child; (3) a spouse; (4) a registered domestic partner; (5) a grandparent; (6) a grandchild;
or (7) a sibling.
- 110 -

--- PAGE 114 of 183 ---

shall prevent a Producer from negotiating a sick leave policy with better
terms and conditions. There shall be no discrimination or retaliation
against any employee for exercising his or her right to use paid sick
leave.
(h) Any dispute with respect to sick leave for employees
covered under the West Coast Studio Local Agreements shall be subject
to the grievance and arbitration procedures provided therein.

PAYROLL COMPANIES' AGREEMENT
This Agreement is made and entered into between _____________
___________________________ (herein "The Payroll Company"), and
the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (herein
"IATSE"), an unincorporated association, upon the following terms,
conditions and recitals:
I. The Payroll Company is a payroll service for the motion
picture and television industries and is an employer member of the
multi-employer bargaining unit represented by the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers, Inc., described in Article V of the
Producer-I.A.T.S.E. & M.P.T.A.A.C. Basic Agreement of 2018 to which
The Payroll Company is a signatory.
II. The Payroll Company's employment of persons subject to the
Basic Agreement and its responsibility to the IATSE therefor shall be
governed by the following:
A. The Payroll Company shall give advance notice to the
IATSE of its involvement in connection with any motion picture or
television production when services falling within the work jurisdiction
of the Basic Agreement are to be performed. Said advance notice shall
be given as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the Monday
immediately following the issuance of the first payroll covering
employees under the Basic Agreement. Said notice may be oral and
confirmed in writing within two (2) working days thereafter and shall
include the following:
1. Name of production company and producer;
2. Title of production;
3. Nature of production (Theatrical, Television,
Commercial, Videotape);
4. Scheduled pre-production, production, and post-
production dates;
5. Production locations; and
6. Whether The Payroll Company is the "primary" or
"secondary" employer as those terms are herein
defined.
The Payroll Company, in addition to the foregoing
notice to the IATSE, shall also, on its own behalf as a "primary"
employer, comply with any notification provisions contained within any
EXHIBIT "A"
- 113 -

--- PAGE 117 of 183 ---

IATSE Local Union Agreement subject to the Basic Agreement or, when
the Payroll Company is the "secondary" employer, require the "primary"
employer to comply therewith.
In the event a Payroll Company consistently fails to
give notice as required by this Section, then an arbitrator in an
arbitration proceeding shall have the authority to issue and fashion an
appropriate remedy.
Absent receipt of the aforementioned notice from the
Payroll Company, The Payroll Company will not be deemed to have any
responsibility for any production merely because someone other than a
designated representative of The Payroll Company represents to the
IATSE or any of its affiliated Locals that it is utilizing the services of
The Payroll Company unless The Payroll Company is in fact providing
such services and failed to give the notice called for herein.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, in the event The Payroll
Company fails to give the advance notice as above required as to more
than one (1) production, the IATSE shall have the right to cancel this
Agreement as to such Payroll Company upon fifteen (15) days written
notice. The IATSE shall notify The Payroll Company of the first
violation, which may be oral and confirmed in writing later.
B. The scope of The Payroll Company's responsibility to
the IATSE and to persons performing services subject to the Basic
Agreement shall be based on whether The Payroll Company is deemed a
"primary" employer or a "secondary" employer insofar as the employees
performing such services are concerned.
1. The Payroll Company shall be deemed the
"primary" employer when it is providing services to a customer
producer/employer which is not a member of the multi-employer
bargaining unit described in Article V of the Basic Agreement.
(a) In its position as a "primary" employer, The
Payroll Company shall provide services to a customer producer/
employer only on the basis that persons working in the crafts and
classifications designated in the IATSE Basic Agreement are employed
under the IATSE Basic Agreement to the same extent as would be
required of any other Producer signatory to the IATSE Basic Agreement.
Notwithstanding any other provision, in the
event a Payroll Company violates the above requirement as a "primary"
employer as to more than one (1) production, the IATSE shall have the
EXHIBIT "A"
- 114 -

--- PAGE 118 of 183 ---

right to cancel this Agreement as to such Payroll Company upon fifteen
(15) days written notice. The IATSE shall notify The Payroll Company
of the first violation, which may be oral and confirmed in writing later.
In the event a Payroll Company fails to
provide coverage to employees under the IATSE Basic Agreement as
required above, an arbitrator shall have the authority to issue an award as
to the full measure of damages.
(b) When a client requests a Payroll Company
to act as the primary employer for a theatrical or television motion
picture with respect to those employees engaged in IATSE-covered
classifications, The Payroll Company shall notify the IATSE of that fact
within one (1) business day after the client requests The Payroll
Company to so act as the primary employer for that picture. In the event
the IATSE is engaged in negotiations with said client, the IATSE shall
notify The Payroll Company and the AMPTP of that fact within one (1)
business day after receipt of said notice from The Payroll Company.
Thereafter, The Payroll Company shall not act as the primary employer
under this Agreement without the consent of the IATSE. If The Payroll
Company does not receive an objection from the IATSE within said one
(1) business day, The Payroll Company may act as the primary employer
under this Agreement.
(c) No contributions will be accepted from The
Payroll Company on behalf of employees employed by an employer
which is not a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement requiring
contributions to the Plans if the non-signatory employer employs one or
more "controlling employees."
A "controlling employee" is defined as any
employee who performs work within any job classification covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with a Union party to the Motion
Picture Industry Pension and/or Health Plans ("Plans") requiring
contributions to be made to the Plans and who is also an officer or
controlling shareholder of the non-signatory employer or the spouse of
such an officer or controlling shareholder. The term "controlling
shareholder" means a person who owns ten percent (10%) or more of the
voting power of the corporation.
The Payroll Company shall be required to
submit a completed Non-Signatory Employer Data Sheet in the form
required by the Plans with respect to each production or other project on
which The Payroll Company is to act as the primary employer.
EXHIBIT "A"
- 115 -

--- PAGE 119 of 183 ---

2. The Payroll Company shall be deemed a
"secondary" employer when it is providing services to a customer
producer/employer which is a member of the multi-employer bargaining
unit described in Article V of the Basic Agreement and The Payroll
Company's customer producer/employer shall be deemed the "primary"
employer in such instances.
C. In those situations in which The Payroll Company is the
primary employer, The Payroll Company shall be deemed the producer
and shall have full responsibility for compliance with all of the terms
and conditions of the Basic Agreement and applicable Local
Agreements, including compliance with requirements in the Local
Agreements relating to deal memos and personal services contracts, until
such time as The Payroll Company gives the IATSE written notice of
cancellation of its agreement with its customer producer/employer and
notwithstanding said notice of cancellation, The Payroll Company shall
remain responsible for all wages (including wages for reasonable time
spent by an employee in returning equipment or properties for which he
is responsible), fringe benefits and conditions of employment to the
effective date of the cancellation and notice to the IATSE and, on distant
location, all expenses due and costs of transportation and salaries for
such transportation time, and for any residual payments (Post '60
payments or Supplemental Market payments) resulting from the
performance of services prior to the notice of said cancellation unless
and until The Payroll Company shall be relieved of responsibility for
such residual payments pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
Exhibit "A." In addition to all other required information, The Payroll
Company shall specify in all reports to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension Plan and the Motion Picture Industry Health Plan the name of
the customer/producer employer, the title of the production and the
classification(s) of employees covered by the Trust Fund payments.
When acting as the "primary employer" for a theatrical
motion picture, The Payroll Company shall be prohibited from
processing and/or issuing any payroll checks for or on behalf of its
customer producer/employer until such time as The Payroll Company
has secured from its customer producer/employer an executed
Assumption Agreement, as provided below, and delivered same to the
Administrator of the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans.
The Assumption Agreement shall be substantially in the following form:
EXHIBIT "A"

"Producer further agrees that the motion picture is covered by
and subject to the provisions of Article XIX of the IATSE
Basic Agreement, 'Post '60 Theatrical Motion Pictures,'
and/or the corresponding provisions of the other applicable
Agreements referred to above (i.e., the applicable provisions
of The Animation Guild Agreement, Article 15 of the
Teamsters Agreement, Article 15 of the IBEW Agreement,
Article 15 of the Plumbers Agreement; Article 15 of the
Laborers Agreement and Article 15 of the Plasterers
Agreement), pertaining to payments due when theatrical
motion pictures, the principal photography of which
commenced in the period August 1, 2018 through July 31,
2021, are released to free television and to the provisions of
Article XXVIII of the IATSE Basic Agreement,
'Supplemental Markets,' and/or the corresponding provisions
of the other applicable Agreements referred to above (i.e., the
applicable provisions of The Animation Guild Agreement,
Article 21 of the Teamsters Agreement, Article 21 of the
IBEW Agreement, Article 21 of the Plumbers Agreement,
Article 21 of the Laborers Agreement and Article 21 of the
Plasterers Agreement), pertaining to payments due for the
release of theatrical motion pictures in Supplemental
Markets.
"Producer hereby agrees, expressly for the benefit of
the Motion Picture Industry Pension and Health Plans
('the Plans') to assume the obligations of said provisions
and to make the payments to the Plans required thereby.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of
Producer to exhibit or license the exhibition of such
motion pictures on free television and/or in
Supplemental Markets shall be subject to and
conditioned upon payment to the Plans as provided in
the respective applicable provisions referred to
hereinabove. It is agreed that such Plans shall be
entitled to injunctive relief and damages against
Producer in the event such payments are not made.
"The Producer agrees to keep or have access to
complete records showing the income derived from the
distribution of such motion pictures to free television
and/or Supplemental Markets and the Plans shall have
the right at all reasonable times to inspect such records.
The Producer shall give the Plans prompt written notice
of the date on which the motion picture is first telecast
EXHIBIT "A"
- 118 -

--- PAGE 122 of 183 ---

on free television and/or is first released in
Supplemental Markets. An inadvertent failure to
comply with said notice requirements shall not
constitute a default by the Producer, provided that such
failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the
Plans.
"Producer further agrees that in the event of a sale,
transfer, license or assignment of the free television
distribution rights or the Supplemental Markets
distribution rights to the above-referenced motion
picture, Producer will obtain from the buyer, transferee,
licensee or assignee an Assumption Agreement
substantially in the form set forth above and shall
provide an executed copy of such Assumption
Agreement to the Plans. In such event, Producer shall
give notice to the Plans, within thirty (30) days of each
sale, transfer, license or assignment of such distribution
rights, with the name and address of the buyer,
transferee, licensee or assignee."
Upon the execution and delivery of such Assumption
Agreement to the Administrator of the Motion Picture Industry Pension
and Health Plans, The Payroll Company shall not be further liable to the
Plans for the keeping of any records required under the "Post '60
Theatrical Motion Pictures" provisions or the "Supplemental Markets"
provisions nor for the payments required thereunder for the exhibition of
the motion picture in Supplemental Markets and/or on free television,
and the Plans shall look exclusively to the Producer or any subsequent
party last executing such an Assumption Agreement for the keeping of
such records and compliance with such payment obligations.
D. In those situations in which The Payroll Company is a
secondary employer, The Payroll Company's responsibility shall be
limited to the monies advanced by the primary employer to The Payroll
Company for wage payments, allowances, penalties, fringe benefits and
payroll taxes for payment to or on behalf of persons who performed
services subject to the Basic Agreement. Provided, however, that should
the primary employer default in its payment obligations to The Payroll
Company and The Payroll Company not promptly cancel its agreement
with the primary employer and simultaneously notify the IATSE of said
termination, as hereinafter provided, then The Payroll Company shall be
responsible for the wage payments, allowances, penalties, fringe benefits
and payroll taxes owing to or on behalf of individuals who performed
services subject to said Basic Agreement for all hours worked by said
EXHIBIT "A"
- 119 -

--- PAGE 123 of 183 ---

persons through the end of the workday on which said notice or
cancellation is given to the IATSE. In such event, The Payroll Company
shall also be responsible for the payment of expenses and costs of
transportation and salaries for transportation time, but only if The
Payroll Company has expressly assumed responsibility therefor. When
The Payroll Company acts only as a secondary employer, the IATSE
shall deem The Payroll Company an agent of the primary employer and
The Payroll Company shall have no responsibility for matters outside of
its control such as, but not limited to, staffing requirements, seniority,
work rules, jurisdictional problems or residual payments (Post '60
payments or Supplemental Market payments). With reference to such
items, the IATSE shall look exclusively to the primary employer for
responsibility. Furthermore, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
in any way reduce, diminish or prejudice any legal or equitable right or
claim that the IATSE. could assert directly against any primary employer
if this Agreement did not exist.
E. Once having given the notice to the IATSE described in
Paragraph A., the scope of The Payroll Company's responsibility as
delineated herein shall continue until such time as The Payroll Company
serves a notice of contract termination upon its customer
producer/employer and simultaneously delivers a copy of said
termination notice to the IATSE.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in Paragraph C.
above, upon delivery of said notice of termination to the IATSE, The
Payroll Company shall forthwith be relieved of all further responsibility
for services to be performed in connection with the production therein
involved on and after the day immediately following the workday on
which said notice of termination is delivered to the IATSE.

termination, whenever possible, must be given to the IATSE. and
employees covered by the Basic Agreement shall be paid, in addition to
their salaries and conditions, all hotel and meal expenses and costs of
transportation and salaries for such transportation time.
F. The Payroll Company shall remit vacation and holiday
pay payments to the employees either on a weekly basis with their
paychecks or by payment in full no later than with their final paycheck at
the end of production. Any payments of unworked holiday pay made to
an employee on a production shall be credited against the 3.719%
accrual. For the purpose of this provision, the "end of production" is
defined as: (1) for television series, upon conclusion of the production
season for episodes ordered and produced; (2) on television "movies of

photography; and (3) for post-production, upon conclusion of post-
production work.
G. This Agreement is effective for a term coinciding with
the term of the Basic Agreement to which The Payroll Company is a
party and shall be extended and renewed from time to time to the same
extent that said Basic Agreement is hereafter extended or renewed.

Re: Special Conditions for Long-Form Television Motion Pictures (Including

TECHNICIANS, ARTISTS AND ALLIED CRAFTS OF THE UNITED STATES, ITS
TERRITORIES AND CANADA, AFL-CIO ("IATSE").
WHEREAS the Producer is a signatory party to the Producer-I.A.T.S.E. Basic Agreement
of 2018 and the West Coast Studio Local Agreements; and
WHEREAS special conditions exist regarding productions of made-for-television long-
form programs, and of long-form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which
are budgeted at $9,000,000 or less, as further described below, concerning whether such
programs or motion pictures will be produced by the Producer; and
WHEREAS special conditions exist in order to preserve and maintain employment for

THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:

provided that no commitment for a series is attached to the pilot order*), as well as
to long-form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which are
budgeted at $9,000,000 or less, which are produced by the Producer in Los
Angeles during the term of the 2018 IATSE Basic Agreement. Additionally, for
made-for-home video productions budgeted at no more than $12,000,000,
Producer may elect to use the terms of the Low Budget Theatrical Agreement as
provided in the Sideletter re Made-For-Home Video Productions.
2. All of the terms and conditions of the IATSE Basic Agreement of 2018 and the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements shall apply, except as provided in the
special conditions in this sideletter.
3. These special conditions shall not apply to any post-production work on the
productions covered hereunder, and all post-production and lab work shall be
performed in accordance with the IATSE Basic Agreement of 2018 and the West
Coast Studio Local Agreements.
4. The roster provisions of the IATSE Basic Agreement and the West Coast Local
Agreements are fully applicable; however, prospective employees are free to
accept or refuse a call to work on any production covered hereunder and any
refusal to accept a call will not count as a refusal under the roster provisions of
Paragraph 68 of the applicable Local Agreements.
5. The special conditions applicable to the productions covered hereunder are:
(i) (A) Notwithstanding any wage rate changes made in the future in the
Basic Agreement and the West Coast Local Agreements, wages are
as listed on the attached "Made for Television Long-Form
Agreement Rate Schedules."
(B) It is the good faith intention of Producer that an employee (other
than an employee engaged as Local #44 "Construction Labor" or
Local #729 "Set Painter") who works in a pay classification for
which a weekly wage rate has not been specified in the applicable
Local Agreement (e.g., Production Painter in Local #729, Grip in

Local #80, and Lamp Operator and Lighting Technician in Local
#728) and who is employed and paid at the weekly wage rate is
being engaged to perform the required work within the
classification for all the time that particular work is needed on the
project (e.g., Producer expects at the time of hiring to utilize a grip
for all three (3) weeks on which grip work is needed during a four
(4) week shoot). Otherwise, the applicable hourly or daily rate
shall be paid for these classifications. This shall not be construed
to be a run-of-the-show guarantee.
However, an employee in the "Construction Labor" and "Set
Painter" craft and classifications on pre-production, for which the
Local Agreement does not provide for a weekly salary, shall be
hired only as a daily employee.
Any allegation of improper application of the above shall be
promptly reviewed by representatives of the affected Local(s), the
IATSE International Office and the Labor Relations Department of
Producer before filing any grievances on the matter.
(ii) Staffing will be fully interchangeable with the following crew:
- Art Director (1) - Sound (¶106 of the Local #695
- Camera (4) Agreement is applicable)
- Set Construction as needed - Greensperson
- Grip Operations (4) - Electrical Operations (4)
- Craft Services (1) - Special Effects as needed
- Production Painter as needed - Set Dressing (3)
- First Aid as needed - Props (2)
- Make-up and Hair Stylist - Wardrobe (2)
(1 each) - Script Supervisor (1)
- Set Designer as needed
(iii) Overtime will be paid at the rate of time and one-half after eight (8) hours
worked, except that daily overtime for Script Supervisors shall be paid as
provided in the Local #871 Agreement (i.e., time and one-half after six (6)
hours); double time, when applicable, to be paid after fourteen (14)
elapsed hours. Overtime pay for weekly employees shall be based on one-
fortieth (1/40) of the weekly rate.

(iv) Meal periods - The time for breaking for the meal period may be extended
by up to one-half hour beyond the time specified in the Local Agreements
without penalty at the request of the Director. Notice for such a delayed
break must be given no later than one (1) hour before the meal period and
the extension may not be scheduled.
(v) Producer will not be required to pay the percentage of salaries for the
specified contractual holidays; however, any employee working on such
holiday will be paid double time. Weekly employees will be paid for any
holiday not worked during their period of employment.
(vi) Producer will not be required to pay the percentage of salaries as vacation
pay.
(vii) Producer will not be required to pay any transportation allowance, such as
specified in Paragraphs 21(c) and 22(b)(2) of the West Coast Studio Local
Agreements.
(viii) An employee hired as a weekly employee shall be paid a full week's pay.
Producer will not prorate the weekly rate for the purpose of paying the
employee on a daily rate or fractional weekly basis, unless the employee
elects not to perform the full week's work (e.g., the employee, hired for a
week, works three days and quits).
6. Prior to actual employment, Producer shall inform and provide written
information to each employee to be hired of the special conditions applicable to
the production.
7. Producer will provide to the appropriate West Coast Studio Locals the name of
the project and, upon request, the names and classifications of the employees who
will be employed under the special conditions of this sideletter.
8. The following additional special terms and conditions shall apply only to two (2)
hour pilots for which there is no series commitment at the time the pilot is ordered
and which are produced under the terms of this sideletter.

(i) Producer agrees to produce all future episodes resulting from the two (2)
hour production under the episodic television provisions of the IATSE
Basic Agreement in Los Angeles County or immediate areas, provided that
when the series is required to be produced outside Los Angeles County or
immediate areas due to creative reasons only, employment of a majority of
the crew from Los Angeles County (or if the episodes are made in one of
the "IATSE production cities") will satisfy this condition.
(ii) When the series is based in Los Angeles County, the Producer may do
location work outside of Los Angeles County on isolated episodes and
employ portions of the crew from Los Angeles County without the number
constituting a majority of the crew from Los Angeles County.
(iii) If principal photography of the first episode commences within seventy
(70) days of completion of principal photography of the two (2) hour long-
form television production, the Producer shall retroactively pay to the
IATSE-represented employees who worked on the two-hour television
production the wages set forth in the episodic television provisions of the
Basic Agreement.
(iv) The AMPTP and the IATSE shall appoint a joint committee to review and
monitor any issues relating to the above.
9. The following additional special terms and conditions shall apply only to long-
form motion pictures made for the videocassette/DVD market which are budgeted
at $9,000,000 or less and which the Producer has elected to cover under the terms
of this sideletter, rather than under the terms of the Low Budget Theatrical
Agreement:
(i) The IATSE shall have the right to audit any such production to ensure that
its budget falls within the aforementioned limitation. If the budget cap is
exceeded, the wages, terms and conditions of the Basic Agreement shall
apply.
(ii) "Behind-the-scenes" shots, when done by the signatory company for such
productions, shall also be covered under the terms of this sideletter.

Re: Productions Made for New Media
Dear Matt:
This Sideletter to the Producer – IATSE Basic Agreement of 20181 confirms the understanding
of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (hereinafter “the IATSE”), on behalf
of itself and its West Coast Studio Local Unions, on the one hand, and the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers, on behalf of the Producers it represented in the negotiations for
a successor agreement to the 2015 Producer – IATSE Basic Agreement (hereinafter collectively
“the parties”), concerning the terms and conditions applicable to the production of entertainment
motion pictures of the type that have traditionally been covered under the Producer – IATSE
Basic Agreement (hereinafter “the Basic Agreement”)2 that are made for the Internet, mobile
devices, or any other new media platform in existence as of August 1, 2009 (hereinafter
1 For convenience only, and without intending to change the meaning or effect of or alter the
interpretation of this Sideletter to the Basic Agreement, the parties agree to reprint this Sideletter in the
West Coast Studio Local Agreements.
2 Such entertainment motion pictures do not include non-dramatic programs and non-prime time dramatic
programs which are instead covered under the Producer – I.A.T.S.E. Videotape Electronics Supplemental
Basic Agreement (hereinafter “the Videotape Agreement”).

collectively referred to as “New Media”).3 With respect to such productions intended for initial
use in new media, the parties agree as follows:
When the parties entered into the 2015 negotiations, they mutually understood that the
economics of New Media production were uncertain and that greater flexibility in terms and
conditions of employment was therefore mutually beneficial. The parties understood that if one
or more business models developed such that New Media production became an economically
viable medium, then the parties would mutually recognize that fact in future agreements.
During the 2018 negotiations, in recognition of emerging subscription video-on-demand services
exhibiting mid-budget and high budget dramatic productions, the parties agreed to modify the
terms and conditions for “mid-budget” dramatic productions made for subscription
video-on-demand consumer pay New Media platforms as provided in Paragraph D. below and
the terms and conditions for “high budget” dramatic productions made for subscription
video-on-demand consumer pay New Media platforms as provided in Paragraph G. below.
A. Recognition
The Producer recognizes the IATSE as the exclusive bargaining representative of
employees employed in the job classifications covered by the West Coast Studio
Local Agreements (hereinafter “the West Coast Studio Local Agreements”) within
the geographic scope of the applicable West Coast Studio Local Agreement on
entertainment motion pictures of the type traditionally covered under the Basic
Agreement, other than those covered under the Videotape Agreement, which are
intended for initial exhibition in New Media, but excluding news, sports,
documentaries and “Experimental New Media Productions,” as that term is
defined below.
B. Coverage
Coverage shall be at the Producer’s option with respect to “Experimental New
Media Productions.” Should the Producer elect to cover an Experimental New
Media Production, the terms and conditions applicable to employment on Original
New Media Productions, as set forth in Paragraph D. below, shall apply.
3 This Sideletter applies to the production of certain types of programs intended primarily for use in New
Media and does not cover work involved in the selection of content for, design or management of any
website or any other New Media platform on which productions made for New Media appear.
- 142 -

--- PAGE 146 of 183 ---

Matthew D. Loeb
Productions Made for New Media
Revised as of August 1, 2018

An “Experimental New Media Production” is defined as any Original New Media
Production: (1) for which the actual cost of production does not exceed: (a)
$15,000 per minute of program material as exhibited, and (b) $300,000 per single
production as exhibited, and (c) $500,000 per series of programs produced for a
single order; and (2) on which fewer than four (4) employees as hereinafter
described are working in job classifications covered by, and within the geographic
scope of, an industry-wide agreement between Employers and the IATSE, or a
Local thereof, which agreement covers television productions as well as
productions made for new media. With respect to any employee working within
the geographic scope of the Basic or Videotape Agreement, such employees shall
include any person listed on the Industry Experience Roster established by the
Basic Agreement, or in the case of employees working in classifications with no
Roster, any person who has thirty (30) or more days of work experience within the
last three (3) years, either alone or in combination, under the West Coast Studio
Local Agreement covering that classification, the Videotape Agreement, or on
New Media productions covered under this Sideletter or the corresponding
Sideletter in the Videotape Agreement.4 With respect to any employee working in
the respective classifications and geographic scope of any other industry-wide
Agreement described in the first sentence of this paragraph, such employees shall
include any person who has thirty (30) or more days of work experience within
the last three (3) years under any such Agreement and/or on New Media
productions covered under any such Agreement.5 Notwithstanding the preceding
two sentences, in determining whether fewer than four (4) such employees are
employed on the production, the following employees shall not be counted:
employees not specifically charged to the production or who are included in
general overhead; script coordinators and writers’ room assistants; projectionists
and in-house publicists (but not unit publicists); and employees engaged in post-
production or distribution functions, including, but not limited to, editing and
looping, regardless of where or when those functions are performed, but excluding
the editor, provided that such editor is working in conjunction with the shooting
company.
The actual cost of the Experimental New Media Production shall consist of all
direct costs actually incurred in connection with the Production. The only costs
excluded in determining the actual cost of production shall be development costs,
overhead charges, financing costs (i.e., loan origination fees, gap fees, legal fees
and interest), contingency of up to ten percent (10%), essential elements insurance
costs, the cost of the completion bond, marketing expenses, contingent payments
4, 5 The Producer shall be entitled to rely on the representation of the employee as to whether he or she
meets the “thirty (30) or more days of work experience within the last three (3) years” requirement.

to talent or other parties which are based on the proceeds derived from the
exploitation of the Production and received after recoupment of the negative cost,
and delivery items required by sales agents, distributors or sub-distributors (i.e.,
delivery materials beyond the answer print, NTSC Video Master if the Production
is delivered on videotape, or the digital equivalent if the Production is delivered in
a digital format).
If the Producer began production of an “Experimental New Media Production”
which the Producer elected not to cover under the terms of this Sideletter, but
subsequently employs four (4) or more employees on the production in job
classifications covered by, and within the geographic scope of, an industry-wide
collective bargaining agreement which meets the description in the first sentence
of the second paragraph of this Paragraph B., and such employees meet the
description in either the second or third sentence of the second paragraph of this
Paragraph B., and are not excluded pursuant to the fourth sentence of said
paragraph, then said production shall automatically be deemed covered hereunder,
starting from the first day on which at least four (4) or more such employees are
so employed on the production and continuing until the production is finished.
Producer shall use reasonable efforts to notify the IATSE that it intends to cover
an “Experimental New Media Production” by the start of principal photography.
C. Terms and Conditions of Employment on Derivative New Media Productions
(Other than a Derivative High Budget New Media Production Made
Primarily for Exhibition on a Subscription Video-On-Demand Consumer
Pay Platform (“High Budget SVOD Program”))
A “Derivative New Media Production” is a production made for New Media
based on an existing television motion picture covered by the Basic Agreement,
other than a non-dramatic or non-prime time dramatic program covered under the
Videotape Agreement, that was produced for “traditional” media – e.g., a free
television, basic cable or pay television motion picture (“the source production”) –
and is otherwise included among the types of motion pictures traditionally
covered by the Basic Agreement, but is not a non-dramatic program or non-prime
time dramatic program covered under the Videotape Agreement.
Employees may be employed by a Producer and assigned to a Derivative New
Media Production as part of their regular workday on the source production. The
work for the Derivative Production shall be considered part of the workday for the
employees on the source production and shall trigger overtime if work on the
Derivative Production extends the workday on the source production past the
point at which overtime would normally be triggered on the source production.

All other terms and conditions, including benefits, shall continue as if the
employee were continuing to work on the source production.
In all other situations, terms and conditions of employment for a Derivative New
Media Production (other than a derivative High Budget SVOD Program, the terms
and conditions of employment for which are provided in Paragraph G.) are freely
negotiable between the employee and the Producer, except for those provisions
identified in Paragraph E. below which shall be automatically applicable to
employees.
D. Terms and Conditions of Employment on Original New Media Productions
(Other than an Original “High Budget SVOD Program”)
(1) Terms and conditions of employment on Original New Media Productions
(other than a “Mid-Budget SVOD Program” as defined in Paragraph D.(2)
below and other than an Original “High Budget SVOD Program” as
defined in Paragraph G. below) are freely negotiable between the
employee and the Producer, except for those provisions identified in
Paragraph E. below which shall be automatically applicable to employees.
(2) (a) The terms and conditions set forth in this Paragraph D.(2) shall be
applicable prospectively only. They shall not apply to:
(i) any program or series that would otherwise qualify as a
“Mid-Budget SVOD Program” within the meaning of this
Sideletter, for which the principal photography of the
program, in the case of a one-time program, or the principal
photography of the first episode, in the case of a series,
commenced prior to August 1, 2019; or
(ii) any program or series that would otherwise qualify as a
“Mid-Budget SVOD Program” within the meaning of this
Sideletter, for which the principal photography of the
program or the first episode of the series commenced after
August 1, 2019, if such program or series was produced
pursuant to the terms of a bona fide license agreement with
fixed and definite terms entered into by the Producer prior
to August 1, 2019.
However, if such license agreement is entered into subject
to conditions precedent, then all such conditions must be
satisfied prior to August 1, 2019.

shall be subject to Paragraph D.(1) of this Sideletter. However,
with respect to any such program or series described in
subparagraphs (i) or (ii) above, if the licensee orders additional
programs or episodes pursuant to the terms of the license
agreement after August 1, 2019 and the Producer has the right to
negotiate with respect to the material terms and conditions of the
license for the additional programs or episodes, then such
additional programs or episodes shall be subject to this Paragraph
D.(2).6
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Producer shall not reduce the
terms and conditions of employment previously provided to
IATSE-represented employees on programs or series covered by
subparagraphs (i) or (ii) above.
(b) Mid-Budget SVOD Programs Defined

$1,300,000
36-65 Minutes $1,750,000 or more but less than
$2,500,000
6 In the event that Producer asserts that a program or series is grandfathered under the provisions of the
second paragraph of Paragraph D.(2)(a) above, a limited number of representatives of the IATSE, subject
to the execution of a confidentiality agreement satisfactory in form to Producer, may inspect those
portions of the license agreement that are relevant to determine whether the Producer had the right to
renegotiate with respect to the material terms and conditions of the license for the additional programs or
episodes. All information received or reviewed by representatives of the IATSE shall be kept
confidential, and neither the IATSE nor its representatives shall disclose any such information, except as

streaming), then Producer shall have a twenty-six (26) consecutive
week period of use on consumer pay platforms, commencing with
the first day of use on consumer pay platforms, without the

Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health Plans 5.4% of the
“Producer’s gross,” as that term is defined in Paragraph 3 of the
“Sideletter re Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted via New
Media,” realized from any subsequent license which includes use

calendar days following the close of the calendar or fiscal
quarter in which the initial domestic theatrical release
occurred. Payment of the foregoing amounts covers all
theatrical exhibitions of the Program in perpetuity.
It is understood that a theatrical motion picture that is
exhibited on a subscription video-on-demand consumer pay
new media platform is not subject to the foregoing residual;
instead, the Sideletter re Exhibition of Traditional Motion
Pictures Via New Media applies.
(iii) This Paragraph G.(5)(f) shall expire upon termination of the
2018 IATSE Basic Agreement.
(6) The number of subscribers in the United States and Canada shall be
determined as of July 1st of each year of the Agreement. For a High
Budget SVOD series, the number of subscribers that applies to the first
episode of the season shall apply to the entire season in perpetuity.
15 The bargaining parties agree that this payment shall not reduce the minimum funding otherwise
required for the Pension Plan (in other words, when determining whether the minimum funding
requirement of the Pension Plan has been met, no reduction shall be made in the amount of Supplemental
Markets monies that would otherwise be allocated to the Pension Plan by reason of amounts payable
under this provision).

H. Representatives of the IATSE shall have the right to review the budget of a
covered new media production solely for the purpose of determining whether the
covered new media production falls within the definition of a Mid-Budget SVOD
Program as set forth in Paragraph D.(2) above or a High Budget SVOD Program
as set forth in Paragraph G. above, and, if so, whether the production meets the
budget break in Tier 1 or Tier 2 as set forth in Paragraph G.(3) above. Producer
agrees to cooperate and provide requested relevant additional information about
the budget that is reasonably available to it. All information received or reviewed
by representatives of the IATSE shall be kept confidential, and neither the IATSE
nor its representatives shall disclose any such information, except as necessary to
enforce its rights under this Agreement.
I. “Sunset” Clause
The parties recognize that these provisions are being negotiated at a time when the
business models and patterns of usage of productions in New Media are in the
process of exploration, experimentation and innovation. Therefore, except as
provided in the next paragraph, the provisions of this Sideletter shall expire on the
termination date of the Basic Agreement and will be of no force and effect
thereafter. No later than sixty (60) days before that expiration date, the parties
will meet to negotiate new terms and conditions for reuse of productions made for
New Media.
The terms and conditions herein applicable to High Budget SVOD Programs,
other than the provisions of Paragraph G.(5)(f) herein, shall apply and remain in
full force and effect, and without change, to High Budget SVOD Programs
produced by the Producer hereunder, regardless of the terms or provisions of any
agreement which is a modification, extension or renewal of, or substitution for,
this Sideletter.

Re: Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via New Media
Dear Matt:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage
Employees (“the Union”) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, on behalf
of the Producers it represented in negotiations for a successor agreement to the 2015 Producer –
IATSE Basic Agreement (collectively “the parties”), concerning the application of the 2018
Producer – IATSE Basic Agreement (hereinafter “the Basic Agreement”) to the exhibition on the
Internet, mobile devices (such as cell phones or PDAs) and any other new media platform known
as of August 1, 2009 (hereinafter collectively referred to as “New Media”) of theatrical and
television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or after February
1, 1973.1, 2
1 The payments provided for under this Sideletter shall only be due in connection with those
theatrical and television motion pictures to which the Supplemental Markets provisions of the
Basic Agreement apply. It is agreed that the proration provisions, and the understandings set
forth in subparagraph (g) of the Supplemental Markets provision, shall apply to any payments
due under this Sideletter.
2 For “feature length primarily animated motion pictures,” as that term is defined in subsection
(f)(1) of Article XXVIII of the Basic Agreement, this understanding applies only to those feature
length primarily animated motion pictures produced and/or released on or after November 1,
1992, as provided in Article XXVIII(f)(2).

1. If the Consumer Pays
a. License for Limited Period or Fixed Number of Exhibitions
When the subscriber pays for the program either on a subscription or per-
picture basis, and when the payment is in exchange for the right to view
the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or a fixed number
of exhibitions, the Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry
Pension and Health Plans five and four-tenths percent (5.4%)3, 4 of
“Producer’s gross,” as defined in Paragraph 3 below,5 subject to the
Producer’s right to prorate on a comparable basis as provided in Article
XXVIII of the Basic Agreement.
The parties agree that the residuals due under this Paragraph 1.a. shall be
payable in the same manner and to the same extent as applicable to pay
television and pay-per-view as provided in the following provisions of the
Basic Agreement (subject to conforming changes as necessary):
3 In the case of feature length primarily animated motion pictures, the percentage payable shall be
two percent (2%) for those titles listed in subparagraph (B) of Article XXVIII(f)(2)(ii) and shall
be three and six-tenths percent (3.6%) for any such motion picture which has or had its initial
theatrical release on or after November 1, 1992.
4 Should a Producer enter into a license agreement on or after August 1, 2015 with respect to
motion pictures covered under this Basic Agreement and/or under any prior Basic Agreement
that requires Post ‘60s and/or Supplemental Market payments and that provides a minimum
guarantee or non-returnable advance to the Producer in exchange for theatrical distribution rights
as well as distribution rights of the theatrical motion picture in one or more other markets for
which payments are due under this Agreement, including under this Sideletter, the percentage
payable shall be four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the “Producer’s gross” as set forth in Article
XXVIIIA.
5 As bargaining history, this language is based upon the following model: studio licenses to
Movielink (formerly know as Moviefly) the right to transmit the motion picture on the Internet to
the viewer who pays Movielink on a subscription or per-picture basis. Such payment would
enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or limited
number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Columbia-TriStar Home
Entertainment, licenses to Movielink the right to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals
shall be based upon 100% of the license fee paid by Movielink to Columbia-TriStar Home
Entertainment for such picture.

requirements and reporting);
• Article XXVIII(b)(11) and (12) (transfer and assumption); and
• Article XXVIII(c), (d), (e), (f) and (g).
b. Paid Permanent Downloads (“Download-to-Own” or “Electronic Sell
Through”) (“EST”)
The following shall apply only to motion pictures released after August 1,
2009:
If the consumer pays for an EST copy of a theatrical motion picture, the
Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health
Plans 8.1% of 20% of “Producer’s gross,” as that term is defined in
Paragraph 3 below, for the first 50,000 units and 14.625% thereafter.6
If the consumer pays for an EST copy of a television motion picture, the
Producer shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health
Plans 8.1% of 20% of “Producer’s gross,” as that term is defined in
Paragraph 3 below, for the first 100,000 units and 15.75% thereafter.6
2. If the Consumer Does Not Pay
Should the Producer stream a theatrical motion picture on a free-to-the-consumer
basis on advertiser-supported services transmitted via the Internet or mobile
device, it shall pay to the Motion Picture Industry Pension and/or Health Plans
5.4% of “Producer’s gross,” as defined in Paragraph 3 below.6
3. “Producer’s Gross”
a. Definition
The term “Producer’s gross,” for purposes of all reuses in new media of
theatrical and television motion pictures made for traditional media (each

Matthew D. Loeb

hereinafter referred to as “Such Picture”), shall be as defined in Article
XXVIII(b)(1)(ii), except as provided in Article XXVIIIA.(a).7
When the “Producer’s gross” derived from new media exploitation is
received from a related or affiliated entity that acts as the exhibitor/retailer
of such Picture, then the “Producer’s gross” received by the Producer from
the licensing of such rights shall be measured by the exhibitor/retailer’s
payments to unrelated and unaffiliated entities in arms’ length transactions
for comparable pictures, or, if none, then the amounts received by the
Producer from unrelated and unaffiliated exhibitors/retailers in arms’
length transactions for comparable pictures, or, if none, a comparable
exhibitor/retailer’s payments to comparable unrelated and unaffiliated
entities in arms’ length transactions for comparable pictures.
b. Agreements and Data
On a quarterly basis commencing January 1, 2010, within ten (10)
business days after such request, the Producer shall provide for inspection
by IATSE’s designated employee or auditor, at Producer’s premises in Los
Angeles, full access8 to all unredacted license, distribution, and other
agreements pertaining to new media exploitation of covered pictures that
were entered into during the immediately preceding quarter. In any
subsequent quarterly inspection, the IATSE’s designated employee or
auditor may re-inspect any agreements previously inspected and inspect
any agreements not previously inspected.
Upon request, in a manner to be mutually agreed upon in good faith, the
Producer shall expeditiously provide, or make available, to the IATSE data
in its possession or control, or the possession or control of its related
distribution entities, regarding the new media exploitation of covered
pictures, such as number of downloads or streams by source and ad rates,
where relevant to the payments required under this Sideletter.
7 For sake of clarity, “Producer’s gross” specifically includes advertising revenues when
the license, distribution, or other agreement provides for sharing in such revenues.
8 Full access includes access to all agreements, notwithstanding any confidentiality clause
contained therein, and access to all sideletters, exhibits, addenda, and other ancillary documents.

Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via New Media
Revised as of August 1, 2018
Page 5
c. Recordkeeping and Reporting
Payment for exploitation of covered pictures in new media shall be due
sixty (60) days after the end of the quarter in which the “Producer’s gross”
from such exploitation is received. The Producer shall accompany such
payments with reports regarding the “Producer’s gross” derived from such
exploitation, which shall be specified by medium and source whenever
reasonably possible and will be separated from revenues derived from
exploitation of Such Pictures in traditional media. Along with such
payments, the Producer shall provide the IATSE with unredacted copies of
all corollary distributor’s, subdistributor’s, and exhibitor’s statements
relating to the reported “Producer’s gross.”
When the Producer allocates revenues between new media rights and other
rights in any Such Picture, among new media rights in multiple Such
Pictures, or otherwise, it shall specify such allocation.
d. Confidentiality
The information provided to the IATSE by the Producer will be treated as
confidential and appropriate arrangements will be made to safeguard the
confidentiality of that information.
e. Reservation of Rights
With respect to theatrical and television motion pictures, the Producer has
agreed to a separate payment for this use in new media because exhibition
in new media is at this time outside the primary market. The Producer
reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of
release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary
market of distribution of theatrical or television motion pictures and that,
therefore, no additional payment should be made with respect to the
exhibition of theatrical motion pictures or television programs (including
those covered by this Agreement) in new media. The IATSE reserves the
right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert
that regardless of whether other exhibitions are or have become part of the
primary market, residual provisions for theatrical or television motion
pictures so exhibited should be improved.

Re: Virtual MVPD Services
Dear Matt:
During the course of the 2018 negotiations, the parties discussed how the landscape of the free
television marketplace has evolved from the past – when the exhibition of a given television
program was only available to the viewer in the home on a television set on a linear channel at a
specific scheduled time – to the current marketplace, commonly referred to as “TV everywhere”
where the viewing public, in addition to viewing a program on a linear channel at a scheduled
time, is also provided the time-shifted option to view the same program on a variety of digital
devices on a video-on-demand (“VOD”) basis. In addition, in the past, the bargaining parties
agreed that television exhibitions on a linear channel provided through an MVPD, whether such
channel was a free television channel or a basic cable channel, were considered exploitation of
free television rights even though the consumer paid a monthly fee to access such programming.
Consistent with the above, the bargaining parties agree that with respect to new internet delivered
“virtual MVPD” services, such as Sling TV and Sony's PlayStation Vue, and other like services,
such as CBS All Access, (collectively referred to hereafter as “vMVPD Services”), any VOD
rights which are associated with exhibition of the motion picture or episodes of the series
(collectively and alternatively “Programs”) on a linear channel on the vMVPD Service
(commonly referred to as “stacking rights”) shall be considered exploitation of free television
rights and not a form of pay or subscription television and, therefore, Paragraph 1(a) (“If the
Consumer Pays”) of the Sideletter re: Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via New Media
which governs licenses to consumer pay new media platforms for a limited period or fixed
number of exhibitions, shall not apply to such exhibitions. Such exhibitions and associated
“stacking rights,” regardless of whether current or past season episodes are exhibited and
regardless of whether such VOD exhibition contains advertisements, shall be treated the same as
if such programs were exhibited on traditional MVPDs. Any VOD rights related to a motion
picture shall not be deemed “associated with” the right to exhibit it on a linear channel of that
vMVPD Service subsequent to the date on which the right to exhibit the motion picture or
episodes on the linear channel terminated.
