whether it is feasible to have pension contributions for all performers employed under
the Television Agreement made to the SAG Pension Plan, while ensuring that
sufficient contributions are allocated to the AFTRA Retirement Fund to cover any
unfunded liabilities for accrued benefits based upon work under the SAG-AFTRA
Television Agreement and that no Producer shall incur withdrawal liability in the
AFTRA Retirement Fund as a result of any changes made to achieve the above-stated
objectives.

4. Start Date and Soft Work Window (Union Proposal No. 9; Producers’ Proposal No. 6)

“73. PERFORMER’S START DATE
“The following applies to contracts entered into on or after [insert date that is the first
Sunday thirty (30) days after the AMPTP receives notice of ratification]. Section 73 of the
2020 Television Agreement applies to contracts entered into prior to that date.
Y
“(a) In the event a performer is engaged in accordance with Section 71 hereof, but
L
a start date has not yet been provided to the performer by the Producer, performer may
N
terminate such engagement in order to accept conflicting bona fide employment by a third
O
party, subject, however, to the performer first giving Producer a minimum twenty-four (24)
hour period (excluding SaturdaysT, Sundays and holidays) the following minimum period
during which ProducerF may specify a start date which then becomes binding., which conflicts
with the pAroffered third party employment:
L
R
A
D “(a) if a performer informs Producer before noon of a business day, by
N
the end of the same day; or
I
F
“(b) if perform er informs Producer at any other time, by noon of the
T
next business day.
O
N
“(b) In the event a performer is engaged in accordance with Section 71 hereof for a
guest appearance in a continuing role, the Producer shall, at the time of engagement, provide
the performer with a ‘soft work window’ for any episode for which it has not given the
performer a firm start date, which shall reflect the Producer’s reasonable determination,
based on the available information at that time, of the dates on which the performer’s
services will be required, but not to exceed the guaranteed period of employment in the
performer’s contract (based on business days), plus five (5) business days on both ends of the
guaranteed period of employment (the ‘soft work window’). When the Producer elects to
provide a ‘soft work window,’ the following applies in lieu of subparagraph (a) above:
“If the performer obtains a bona fide offer of employment by a third party that
would conflict with the soft work window(s), the performer shall promptly notify the
Producer, and the Producer shall use reasonable efforts to either guarantee a start date or
modify the soft work window(s) so as to not interfere with the performer’s bona fide offer of

employment within twenty-four (24) hours (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays)
from receipt of the performer’s notice. The performer will also cooperate with the Producer
to keep the Producer apprised of any employment with a third party that will occur during the
period beginning with the first day of the earliest soft work window and ending with the last
day of the latest soft work window. In the event a performer is unable to complete work on
an episode due to conflicting employment with a third party outside the soft work window(s)
and is required to return at a later time to finish the episode, the Producer shall not be
obligated to pay for any intervening days.
“It is understood that the Producer may change the soft work window(s) more
than once (e.g., in response to a notice from the performer of a bona fide offer of
employment by a third party or because the Producer has revised its reasonable determination
of the dates on which the performer’s services will be required) without any payment
Y
obligation, provided that any change is subject to the performer’s professional availability at
L
the time the change is made. In the event the Producer has changed the performer’s soft
N
work window(s) in response to the performer’s notice of a conflicting bona fide offer of
O
employment from a third party or is unable to change the soft work window(s) to a period
that does not conflict with the performer’s p rofessional availability and the performer is
T
unable to fulfill the engagement with the Producer, the Producer shall have no obligation to
F
pay the performer for the unfulfilled engagement.”

Modify Section 2.(c) of thTe Television Agreement, and make conforming changes to Sideletter
H of the TeleOvision Agreement and Sideletter 21 of the Codified Basic Agreement, as follows:
N
“Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, the following shall
apply to ‘major role’ performers, as defined below, employed in an episode of a one-half
hour or one-hour network prime time television series, in an episode of a one-half hour or
one-hour television series produced for broadcast in prime time on The CW or in an episode
of a new one-half hour or one-hour scripted, dramatic television series first produced on or
after July 1, 2011 for exhibition in prime time on pay television and which is in its second or
subsequent season. The following shall also apply to ‘major role’ performers employed on
any season of a 20-35 minute or 36-65 minute High Budget SVOD series that commences
principal photography on or after [insert date that is the first Sunday that is one year after the
AMPTP receives notice of ratification] or on the first season of a one-half hour or one-hour
scripted dramatic television series produced for exhibition in prime time on pay television
that commences principal photography on or after [insert date that is the first Sunday that is
one year after the AMPTP receives notice of ratification].

“The parties also acknowledge that their agreement on this provision was originally
negotiated in the context of the existing practice on network prime time shows (at that time,
“network prime time” covered prime time on ABC, CBS and NBC only), and has now been
extended to prime time series on FBC and The CW as well as to certain programs produced
for pay television and certain High Budget SVOD series (see first paragraph of subparagraph
(c) above), and was is intended to apply in those contexts. As to other programs, such as
programs produced for syndication (other than prime time series produced for The CW) or
pay television (other than scripted dramatic television series produced for exhibition in prime
time), the parties recognize that no uniform rate has heretofore been established as a ceiling
on performers’ compensation. However, if during the term of this Agreement, the Union
believes that such a ceiling has been established as a matter of industry-wide practice on
those other programs, it shall have the right to refer the matter to the Cooperative Committee
Y
for resolution. Likewise, if during the term of the Agreement, a Producer believes that it is
L
not appropriate to apply the ‘major role’ performer provision to a program produced for
N
network prime time or for The CW in prime time is not appropriate because it is not of the
O
type currently produced for network prime time television, it shall have the right to refer the
matter to the Cooperative Committee for res olution.”

“(a) Definition of ‘Success Metric’5
“The ‘success metric’ is met when the total number of ‘domestic views’ (see
definition in subparagraph (b) below) divided by the total number of domestic
subscribers6 to the SVOD Service is twenty percent (20%) or more.
“Success Metric Calculation = # Domestic Views
# Domestic Subscribers
“(b) Definition of ‘Domestic Views’
“The number of ‘domestic views’ of a season of a High Budget SVOD series
or a High Budget SVOD multi-part, closed-end series is calculated by
Y
dividing the total hours streamed domestically during the first ninety (90) days
L
after each episode in the season of a High Budget SVOD series or each part of
N
a High Budget SVOD multi-part, closed-end series is made available on the
O
SVOD Service by the total runtime of all episodes in the season or of all parts
of a multi-part, closed-end se ries.
T
F
“For a one-time High Budget SVOD Program, the number of ‘domestic
A
views’ is calculated by dividing the total hours streamed domesticallLy on the
R
SVOD Service during the first ninety (90) days after theA one-time High
D
Budget SVOD Program is made available oNn the SVOD Service by the total
runtime of the High Budget SVOD PIrogram.
F
“(Both theT hours streamed and the runtime are determined by rounding to the
Onearest one-tenth (1/10th) hour.)
N
5 Producer may rely on the determination by the SVOD Service whether the ‘success metric’ has been met for any
High Budget SVOD Program. Subparagraph (f) is the sole mechanism for the Union (and the SBDF) to verify or
obtain information about the success bonus or its calculation.
6 For purposes of determining the success bonus, the SVOD Service shall determine the number of domestic
subscribers as of July 1st of each year of the Agreement. The SVOD Service shall apply that number when the first
episode of the season, the first part of a multi-part, closed-end series or the High Budget SVOD Program is first
made available on the SVOD Service on or after July 1st of the measuring year but not later than June 30th of the
following year. Likewise, the SVOD Service shall make a separate determination of the number of domestic
subscribers for each subsequent Exhibition Year as of July 1st of each year of the Agreement by applying that
number when the first day that the first episode of that season, first part of a multi-part, closed-end series or High
Budget SVOD Program is made available in any second or subsequent Exhibition Year on or after July 1st of the
measuring year but no later than June 30th of the following year. For example, if an SVOD Service has 25 million
domestic subscribers as of July 1, 2023 and makes the first episode of the first season of a High Budget SVOD
series available on March 1, 2024, the applicable number of domestic subscribers is 25 million for purpose of
calculating the success bonus for that season of the series. It is understood by the parties that the foregoing applies
in lieu of Paragraph E.7(a) of this Sideletter.

“Eligibility for the success bonus shall also be determined for each subsequent
Exhibition Year as defined in Paragraph 5(a)(ii)(A). The formula for
determining eligibility is the same as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b)
above, except that the number of total hours streamed is counted for the first
ninety (90) days of the subsequent Exhibition Year.

“In no event shall the requirement to pay part of the success bonus

N“(e) Example: Program XYZ is a High Budget SVOD series with ten (10)
episodes in its second season that are each 35 minutes in length. All episodes
were first made available on the SVOD Service on [insert date that is after the
first Sunday following the AMPTP’s receipt of notice of ratification and on or
after January 1, 2024]. At all relevant times, the SVOD Service has fifty
million (50,000,000) domestic subscribers and eighty million (80,000,000)
foreign subscribers on a worldwide basis. Collectively, all episodes of the
second season of Program XYZ had seventy million (70,000,000) hours
streamed domestically in the first ninety (90) days after the episodes were
made available on the SVOD Service.
"To determine whether the second season of Program XYZ qualifies for a
success bonus in its first Exhibition Year, the total number of domestic views
is determined by dividing the total number of domestic hours streamed of all

episodes in the second season (seventy million (70,000,000) hours) by the
total runtime in hours of the second season (5.8 hours rounded as provided
herein). The ‘success metric’ is then determined by dividing the total number
of domestic views (70,000,000/5.8 hours) by the total number of domestic
subscribers (50,000,000).
Domestic Views = Total Domestic Hours Streamed = 70M
Total Runtime (in hours) 5.8
Success Metric = Domestic Views
Total Number of Domestic Subscribers
= [70M hours ÷ 5.8 hours] ÷ 50M domestic subscribers
Y
= 0.241 (24.1%), which is greater than the twenty percent (20%) threshold for
L
payment and would, therefore, trigger payment of the success bonus.
N
O
“(f) Should the Union provide written notice to the SVOD Service and the
Producer that it disputes whe ther a High Budget SVOD Program qualifies for
T
a success bonus, the dispute shall be submitted promptly to a third party
F
jointly chosen by the SVOD Service and the Union for determination by audit
A
(or other procedure determined by the third party) (hereafter ‘audit’)L. The
R
audit shall be for the sole purpose of verifying to the UnAion, the SBDF, the
D
SVOD Service and the Producer whether thNe season of the High Budget
SVOD series, the High Budget SVODI multi-part, closed-end series or one-
F
time High Budget SVOD Program is entitled to a success bonus (‘yes/no’).
The third pTarty must execute a confidentiality agreement approved by the
OSVOD Service. The Union and the SVOD Service shall evenly split the costs
Nand fees associated with any such audit. The Union (and the SBDF) shall not
be entitled to obtain information about the number of domestic subscribers,
the hours streamed domestically, the running time or the ‘success metric’ of
the High Budget SVOD Program.
“The Union retains any and all rights to pursue grievance and arbitration as
provided in the Agreement should a Producer fail to pay the success bonus
within sixty (60) days after the third party confirms that such a bonus is due.
“Any dispute by the SBDF concerning the success bonus or its calculation
shall be referred to the Union, the Producer and the SVOD Service. The
SBDF shall have no independent right to initiate an audit as provided herein
or to verify or obtain information about the success bonus or its calculation.

“(g) Success Bonus Distribution Fund
“(i) The parties acknowledge and agree that distribution of SBDF funds is
a matter of mutual concern that is not susceptible to resolution within
the collective bargaining process. Accordingly, the parties agree to
establish a jointly-administered SAG-AFTRA—Producers Success
Bonus Distribution Fund (‘SBDF’ or the ‘Fund’) as described herein,
provided that:
“(A) A legal opinion is issued by counsel chosen by the Producers
that the SBDF falls within one of the exceptions to Section
302(c) of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) (29
Y
U.S.C. §186 (Restrictions on Financial Transactions));
L
N
“(B) The SBDF is structured 1) to preserve the Producer’s ability to
O
deduct as a business expense all Fund payments to performers,
including any portion of the success bonus and health and
T
pension/retirement contributions and 2) to fulfill all tax, benefit
F
contribution and other obligations that otherwise would be

owed by Producer on account of any such Fund paymLents.

“(ii) The SBDF will be governed by a BoNard of Trustees, consisting of
three Trustees and one AlternIate Trustee appointed by the AMPTP and

three Trustees and one Alternate Trustee appointed by SAG-AFTRA.
ThTe AMPTP shall have the sole authority to appoint and remove any
OTrustee representing the AMPTP. SAG-AFTRA shall have the sole
N authority to appoint and remove any Trustee representing SAG-
AFTRA.
All actions of the Board shall be determined by a majority of the
Directors present and voting at any duly noticed meeting of the Board,
unless any Trustee calls for a unit vote, in which case the AMPTP-
appointed Trustees shall have one vote and the SAG-AFTRA Trustees
shall have one vote. Alternate Trustees may not vote at such meetings
unless attending in place of a Trustee who is unable to attend.
“(iii) The Board of Trustees will be charged with the oversight of
administration of the SBDF and the distribution of funds payable to
the SBDF pursuant to the terms of the Codified Basic Agreement and
the Television Agreement.

failed to make a required SBDF Payment on a Qualifying Project on a
timely basis and to take appropriate enforcement actions to collect any
SBDF Payment that may be due.
“(v) The Board of Trustees will develop and approve distribution
guidelines that will be applied to determine how the money remitted
into the SBDF will be distributed to performers employed by
Producers that pay into the SBDF on High Budget SVOD Programs

contribution cap, and perform any other functions required of an
emTployer of record, and (D) obtain necessary data from, and provide
Onecessary data to, the applicable benefit plans, including data
N necessary to determine the application of contribution caps.

herein beginning sixty (60) days after the AMPTP receives notice that
the SBDF is fully operational consistent with the provisions of this
subparagraph (g) and the Trustees have adopted guidelines for the
distribution of the funds as provided herein. No payment to the SBDF
shall be required before then.

bonus payments to individual performers in accordance with the
guidelines approved by the Trustees, issue health and
pension/retirement contributions up the applicable contribution cap on
those bonus payments and provide tax and other reporting to those

distributed by the Fund.
“(ix) The SBDF shall issue an annual report to each contributing Producer,
the Union and the AMPTP detailing, at a minimum, the following:

skilled in working on all hair textures and skin tones (including, for example, styling and
cutting natural textured hair, braiding and twisting techniques, flat top and fade haircuts,
matching correct concealer and foundation with skin tone, and knowledge of appropriate
hair and make-up products and tools). The parties agree it is important to expand and
maintain a pool of qualified hair stylists and make-up artists who have the necessary
skills and experience to work with cast members of all races and ethnicities and commit
Y
to making efforts to do so. The parties also acknowledge that this endeavor will require

“To address these concerns, the parties agreed that productions must offer performers the
opportunity to consult with someone on production regarding their hair and/or make-up
needs prior to commencing work, so that this information can be communicated to the
hair and/or make-up department, and the hair and/or make-up department can be

departments at the beginning of production of the need for qualified hair stylists and
make-up artists who have the experience, skills and knowledge to work with cast
members of all races and ethnicities, as well as products and tools for all hair textures and

that learns patterns from data and produces content based on those patterns (e.g.,
ChatGPT4, MidJourney, Dall-E2). It does not include ‘traditional AI’ technologies
programmed to perform specific functions (e.g., CGI and VFX), such as those already
used during all stages of motion picture production (e.g., pre-visualization, pre-

Performer’ is a digitally-created asset that: (1) isI intended to create, and does create, the

clear impression that the asset is a natural performer who is not recognizable as any

Nmotion picture exists with a natural performer in the role being portrayed by the asset.
“The parties acknowledge the importance of human performance in
motion pictures and the potential impact on employment under this Agreement when a
Synthetic Performer created through a GAI system is used in a human role that would
otherwise be performed by a human. For those reasons, the Producer agrees to give the
Union notice and an opportunity to bargain in good faith over appropriate consideration,
if any, if a Synthetic Performer is used in place of a performer who would have been
engaged under this Agreement in a human role.

“If a Producer intends to create, and does create, a Synthetic Performer
with a principal facial feature (i.e., eyes, nose, mouth and/or ears) that is recognizable as
that of a specific natural performer through the use of such identified natural performer’s

“During the 2023 negotiations, the Union discussed the importance to the advancement of

performers’ and background actors’ careeFrs of accurate credits appearing on the IMDb
website, which is commoTnly used by producers and casting directors for the purpose of
verifying a pOerformer’s or background actor’s previous work experience. This will confirm
that the Producers agreed to make reasonable efforts to assist a performer whom it employed
N
on a motion picture who is unable to obtain from other sources the corroborating information
needed to correct or add a credit on IMDb. Background actors may contact the background
casting agency through which they were hired if they are unable to obtain from other sources
the corroborating information needed to correct or add a credit on IMDb. The AMPTP will
contact the major background casting agencies to advise them that they should make
reasonable efforts to assist a background actor in the event they are contacted by a
background actor for this purpose.”

stricter standards.

application of the Agreement to Max. This agreement was renewed as provided
herein during the negotiations for successor agreements to the 2020 SAG-AFTRA
Agreements.
“Max offers over-the-top delivery of HBO's pay television service and carries all of
that service's programming (such programming will be referred to collectively as the
‘Pay Television Service’). Max also offers motion pictures and programs initially
exhibited in theatrical and television markets (such motion pictures and programs will
be referred to as ‘Library Content’). Finally, Max offers original New Media
productions made for initial exhibition on Max.
“Consumers can access Max by subscribing to Max directly. In addition, some
subscribers to the Pay Television Service (such as those who subscribe to HBO

distributors) will be given the opportunity to access Max at no additional charge by
authenticating their Pay Television Service subscription and then accessing the Max
platform via a log-in process. In the future, consumers may also be able to access and

carriers and services to offer Max through their respective platforms.

“1. All programs or motion pictures, including Library Content, made available or
exhibited on the Pay Television Service and, therefore, made available on Max shall
