                      for Occ. Code #5741 (Hair Stylist Department Head) shall match the per
                      hour minimum wage rate in the corresponding daily and weekly wage
                      schedules for Occ. Code #5700 (Make-up Department Head). In the case
                      of a Hair Stylist Department Head (Occ. Code #5741) employed on an “on

               iii.   The per hour minimum wage rate in all daily and weekly wage schedules
                      for Occ. Code #5751 (Hair Stylist) shall match the per hour minimum
                      wage rate in the corresponding daily and weekly wage schedules for Occ.
                      Code #5721 (Make-up Artist).

               iv.    The per hour minimum wage rate in all daily and weekly wage schedules

                      #1837 (Hair Stylist) shall match the per hour minimum wage rate in the
                      corresponding daily and weekly wage schedules for Occ. Code #1835
                      (Make-Up Artist).

       b.      Effective [August 1, 2024, or the first Sunday following the business day on which

             # 5742 (Assistant Hair Stylist Department Head), Occ. Code # 5751 (Hair Stylist)
             and Occ. Code 5752 (Hair Stylist Trainee) as follows:

             i.      Paragraph 1(a)(1)(i), 1(a)(2)(i) and 1(a)(3)(i) (i.e., studio minimum wage
                     scales for employees employed on motion pictures other than one-half
                     hour prime time dramatic television motion pictures recorded digitally) –
                     Move from Schedule B (weekly guarantee of 48.6 cumulative hours, with
                     time and one-half after 48.6 hours in a week, and a minimum call of 8
                     hours) to Schedule C (weekly guarantee of 54 cumulative hours, with time

             ii.     Paragraph 1(a)(1)(ii), 1(a)(2)(ii) and 1(a)(3)(ii) (i.e., studio minimum wage
                     scales for employees employed on one-half hour prime time dramatic
                     television motion pictures recorded digitally) – Move from Schedule B-3
                     (weekly guarantee of 45 cumulative hours, with time and one-half after
                     48.6 hours in a week, and a minimum call of 8 hours) to Schedule C-1

                     hours in a week, and a minimum call of 8 hours).

2.    Safety and Parking

      Producers agree to distribute the following bulletin to the appropriate production
      personnel:

      “During the 2024 negotiations with Local 706, the Union and the Producers discussed
      safety concerns arising from the fact that Hair Stylists and Make-up Artists are often
      some of the first employees to come to work in the morning and some of the last
      employees to leave at night. As a result, those employees frequently find themselves
      walking alone to or from a parking lot in the dark. Often, they are also transporting their
      kit, sometimes over unpaved surfaces with uneven terrain. Local 706 expressed concerns
      about safety, both because the employees are often alone and because the combination of
      darkness and uneven terrain makes footing uncertain, particularly in locations where the
      streets and/or parking lot are not well lit.

      “Productions must be cognizant of the safety of Make-up Artists and Hair Stylists upon
      their arrival and departure. When the conditions described in the preceding paragraph
      exist, productions should offer these employees an escort and/or transportation to and
      from their cars, to the extent it is reasonably practicable to do so. Make-up Artists and
      Hair Stylists should also feel free to ask for these services if they have safety concerns.
      Furthermore, production security or other production personnel should be present and
      ready to assist Make-up Artists and Hair Stylists who are arriving early and leaving late.”

3.    Notating NDBs

      Producers agree to distribute the following bulletin to the appropriate production
      personnel:

      “During the 2024 negotiations with Local 706, the Union raised a concern that Hair
      Stylists and Make-up Artists are sometimes asked to notate on their time cards that they
      have taken a non-deductible breakfast (“NDB”) when in fact they have not. The Union
      also reported that other employees sometimes mark an NDB on the Hair Stylists’ and
      Make-up Artists’ time cards when they have not taken an NDB.

      “Productions are hereby reminded that employees should never be asked to report
      information on their time cards that is not accurate, nor should other individuals modify
      the time card of an employee to report inaccurate information.

      “Any employee who is asked to report an NDB on a time card, and who has not in fact
      taken an NDB, should immediately contact a representative of Producer’s Labor
      Relations department (or may contact a representative of Local 706 and ask that Local
      706 contact the Producer on the employee’s behalf) and report the incident. Likewise, if
      an employee’s time card is modified to include an NDB that the employee has not taken,
      the employee (or Local 706) should so report to Labor Relations. When the Producer is
      notified, a Labor Relations representative will promptly investigate and, if requested,
      shall endeavor to maintain in confidence the identity of the employee who was the source
      of the report.

      “This bulletin will also serve as a reminder that an employee who has been instructed to
      take an NDB, whether by direction on the call sheet or otherwise, should do so unless the
      employee has received approval from a supervisor not to do so.”

4.    Star Waivers (706-P-01)

      Modify the Unpublished Sideletter re: Paragraph 68(b) (Star Waivers) as follows:

      “The provisions of Paragraph 68(b) which allow the Producer to ‘call, retain or recall out
      of Industry Experience status’ shall include one (1) make-up artist and/or one (1) hair
      stylist up to a cumulative total of four (4) make-up artist(s) and/or hair stylist(s) in
      any combination employed to work on a production because of a relationship as a make-
      up artist or hair stylist with a star who is essential to the production. In such notice
      provided to the Union, Producer shall include a description in writing of the make-up
      artist/hair stylist work experience relied upon to establish a working relationship with the
      star. Such verification of the working relationship may include copies of pay stubs, call
      sheets, tearsheets or other documentation. Such notice shall be provided to the Union as
      soon as the Producer's Labor Relations department becomes aware of the engagement of
      a make-up artist(s) and/or hair stylist(s) pursuant to the terms of this sideletter. Should a
      dispute arise as to whether such person was properly hired under the terms of this
      sideletter, the protest procedures described in the last three (3) paragraphs of Paragraph


00311463.DOCX; 5
2024 Local 706 Memorandum of Agreement
Page 5

      68(b) (starting with "If no protest is presented to Producer by the Union Representative ...
      ," etc.) shall apply, except that the time period for filing a protest shall be within forty-
      eight (48) hours after receipt of such notice, Saturdays, Sundays and recognized holidays
      excepted, unless the Producer advises the Union in writing that a shorter period is
      required, in which case the forty-eight (48) hour period shall be reduced to twenty-four
      (24) hours after receipt of such notice.

      “Persons employed pursuant to this sideletter shall be eligible for placement on the
      Industry Experience Roster upon satisfaction of the requirements for placement set forth
      in Paragraph 68(b) of the Local #706 Agreement, except that any person so employed at
      the request of only one star shall not be placed on the Industry Experience Roster unless
      such person either: (1) has been called at least three (3) times by such star and has
      worked a total of thirty (30) days; or (2) has been called once by such star and has
      worked a total of sixty (60) days on a single production with that star.

      “An Abuse Review Committee shall be established which shall meet upon request for the
      purpose of discussing alleged abuses of this sideletter.

      “Except as modified herein, this sideletter shall be interpreted in accordance with mythe
      letter to Tommy Cole to you dated April 17, 1995.”
