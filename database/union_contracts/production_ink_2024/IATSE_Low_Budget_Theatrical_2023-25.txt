(“Employer”) and the INTERNATIONALALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYES,
MOVING PICTURE TECHNICIANS, ARTISTS AND ALLIED CRAFTS OF THE UNITED
STATES AND CANADA, AFL-CIO, CLC (“IATSE” or “Union”) for itself and on behalf of its
affiliated locals and members of the bargaining unit described in Article II.
The Employer is engaged in the production of low budget theatrical productions
throughout the United States and Canada for first exhibition in theatrical release. The IATSE
represents motion picture technicians and artisans whose services are utilized by the Employer in
connection with its productions. It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Agreement establish
the wages and working conditions applicable to such motion picture production technicians and
artisans.
ARTICLE I. SCOPE AND APPLICATION
A.
This Agreement shall be applicable to all low budget theatrical productions (as
defined herein), produced in the United States or Canada, subject to the Canadian Supplement
hereto, by Employer or by production entities which it controls, for first exhibition in theatrical
release. As set forth herein, this Agreement shall be applicable to any feature length motion
picture which has production costs budgeted within the low budget tiers reflected below.
Production costs (“production costs”) means all production costs, “above” and “below the line”
costs, “pre-production,” “production” and “post-production.” The costs of the premium for a
completion bond and the contingency fund not to exceed ten percent (10%) of the budget shall
not be included as part of the production costs.

C.
Prior to the commencement of pre-production work on a motion picture as
defined above and covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall provide written notice to the
IATSE General Office with the following information, a copy of the budget, and if known the
crew list when available (or may submit the information, if known, in the form of a Project
Information Sheet, attached as Appendix E to this Agreement) for each theatrical motion picture
on which employees are employed under this Agreement no later than two (2) weeks after
opening a production office for such motion picture or production. The Employer shall serve
written notice on the IATSE General Office of its intent, or that of another production entity, to
employ persons under this Agreement prior to engaging such employees for a given production.
Such notice shall contain at least the following information, if known:
(a) Project Title;
(b) Signatory Employer;
(c) Production Company(ies), if different from Signatory;
(d) Location;
(e) Start & Completion Date
(f) Production office address and phone number;
(g) Line Producer/UPM/Labor Relations contact(s) with phone number(s) and
email addresses(es);
(h) Payroll Services, if applicable;
(i) Budget.
There shall be no penalty for inadvertent failure to comply with this provision.
Representatives of IATSE or retained professionals shall have the right to review
the budget and the above specified information and make inquiries to Employer concerning the
budget. Employer agrees to cooperate and provide the additional information to the extent it can
reasonably do so.
D.
Employer shall provide the IATSE, upon request, with a report of the actual
expenditures of the production (Final Expenditure Report) and such other relevant materials as
the IATSE may require which show the actual cost of the production. In the event that the
production costs (excluding costs reimbursed by insurance) of the motion picture have exceeded
the applicable budget Tier by more than ten percent (10%) as determined by the budget
established at commencement of principal photography, then the employees employed on the
motion picture and covered by Appendix A, paragraphs l(a) and (b) shall be paid retroactively for
all hours worked or paid for at the wage rates, premiums, overtime, travel pay, and all
identifiable labor costs that would be applicable under the provisions of the then current IATSEProducer Basic Agreement and IATSE Local Agreements. 2 For employees covered under
Appendix A, paragraph 2, the wage rates shall be paid retroactively with a ten percent (10%)
increase. If such overages are caused by an act of God, fire, earthquake, or governmental action,
the above-referenced retroactive additional payments shall not be required. Notwithstanding the
above-stated provisions, if the actual production costs (excluding costs reimbursed by insurance)
of the motion picture exceed the applicable budget Tier with a ten percent (10%) or greater
2

References in Article I.D, to the Basic Agreement and Local Agreements for productions based in Canada
shall be deemed to be references to the standard Local IATSE agreement applicable to theatrical motion picture
production in the Province where production takes place.

variance and the Employer provides written notice to the IATSE that the production costs
(excluding costs reimbursed by insurance) have exceeded the applicable ceiling in the relevant
low budget category established under this Agreement no later than two (2) weeks prior to the
completion of all post-production, then the wage rates applicable hereunder shall be
automatically adjusted to the rates applicable to productions in the category established under
this Agreement that encompasses the production costs of the production. If Employer fails to
provide the above written notice of a ten percent (10%) or greater variance, and/or if the
production costs (excluding costs reimbursed by insurance) exceed the applicable Tier Three
limit, with a ten percent (10%) or greater variance, then the labor costs as described in the IA
Basic Agreement and the Local Agreements shall be applicable on a retroactive basis.
E.
All information received or reviewed by representatives of the IATSE or retained
professionals shall be confidential and neither the IATSE nor its representatives or retained
professionals shall disclose any such information except as necessary to enforce their rights
under this Agreement.
F.
The Union shall have the right at any time, whether during pre-production,
production, post-production, or after exhibition, to inspect at the Employer’s offices all records,
documents, and information relating to the budget and the actual costs of the production,
including the right to use retained professionals. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article XI,
the Union shall have the right to inspect budget records as set forth above and to assert a
grievance and proceed to arbitration on the enforcement and implementation of the provisions of
this Article I within twelve (12) months following the initial release or exhibition of a covered
film.
ARTICLE II. RECOGNITION

representative of all production technicians and artisans employed in classifications traditionally
represented by the Union under the IATSE-Producer Basic Agreement including production
coordinators, assistant production coordinators, production accountants, assistant production
accountants and art department coordinators. 3 This Agreement is not applicable to office clerical
employees, production assistants, guards or supervisors as defined by the National Labor
Relations Act. 4

accountants, art department coordinators, publicists, and story analysts shall be included on a production basis only.
4
For theatrical motion pictures whose budgets exceed Tier III limitations, see Article XXXI. For all other
projects the Employer intends to produce in Canada, the Employer will notify the IATSE in advance and will discuss
its intended production plans for Canada with the appropriate Canadian affiliate(s) of the IATSE, and specifically
projects bound to the Canadian Supplement hereto.

3

C.
Where behind the scene production work is being performed by employees on the
payroll of the Employer, their work shall be subject to the appropriate collective bargaining
agreement.
ARTICLE III. SUBCONTRACTING
A.
There shall be no subcontracting of historically and traditionally performed
bargaining unit work except as provided herein.
B.
The various work flows made possible by digital motion picture technology shall
not be sub-contracted from the time the recorded media leaves the digital imaging source through
and including the delivery of the media to the editor. This work is within the jurisdiction of the
IATSE and covered by this Agreement, without respect to where it is performed (including, but
not limited to on set, adjacent to set, near set or at a location otherwise created by mobile
operations).
ARTICLE IV. UNION SECURITY
A.
Employees covered by this Agreement, as a condition of employment, shall
become and thereafter remain members in good standing of the Union on and after the thirtieth
day of their employment or thirty days following the execution of this Agreement, whichever is
later. The foregoing shall be subject to and limited by applicable law and to the extent that any
applicable law does not permit the form of union security herein provided, then and in that event,
this Agreement shall be deemed to provide for the maximum form of union security permitted by
said law. The foregoing shall be deemed satisfied by membership in any local union affiliated
with the Union. “Members in good standing” shall be defined, interpreted and implemented by
the parties in compliance with applicable law including an employee who meets the financial
obligations only in accordance with the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.
B.
The Employer shall not object to the payroll company deduction of all appropriate
union dues/service fees from all wages earned by the employees covered by this Agreement who
have executed the appropriate payroll deduction authorization form.
ARTICLE V. ADMINISTRATION
In order to achieve consistency and continuity in the administration of this Agreement,
and its Canadian Supplement, the IATSE shall designate both a U.S. East Coast and West Coast
and Canadian representative responsible for the administration of the Agreement. The Employer
shall designate a representative responsible for the administration of the Agreement.
ARTICLE VI. ACCESS
The designated representatives of the Union, including local union representatives

4

ARTICLE VII.

RECORDS AND RESPONSIBILITIES

A.
By virtue of this Article VII, the Employer hereby authorizes any payroll service
it has engaged to process payroll for a theatrical production subject to this Agreement to provide
payroll information on employees covered by this Agreement employed on such production to an
authorized representative of the IATSE upon request. The IATSE will notify the Employer of
such request to its payroll service.
B.
In the event an Employer uses a payroll company or other outside person(s), or
entity (herein referred to as the payroll service) to handle or facilitate the payment of wages or
other benefits to or on behalf of an employee or employees covered under this agreement, the
employer agrees and acknowledges that it is and remains the Employer of such employee(s) for
the purposes of all provisions of this Agreement, and that the Employer remains liable and
responsible for compliance with such provisions.
ARTICLE VIII.

JOB STEWARD

The IATSE may appoint separate stewards for production and off production units. The
identity of the designated steward shall be made known to the production manager of each
covered motion picture. It is understood that the steward shall in no way be discriminated against
for any cause whatsoever in the performance of their duties as a steward.
ARTICLE IX. NO DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT OR ABUSIVE CONDUCT
The parties agree that under this Agreement, there shall be no discrimination with respect
to wages, terms, conditions, privileges of, or opportunities for employment because of race,
color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender, gender identity, gender expression, military or
veteran status, medical condition (including genetic characteristics), sexual orientation, age,
national origin, disability, linguistic characteristics (such as accent or limited English proficiency
where not justified by business necessity), marital status, Union membership or any other basis
prohibited by law.
The Union and the Employer recognize the importance of the Employer’s statutory
obligations to provide a workplace free from unwanted sexual harassment and abusive conduct
and shall cooperate with each other toward that end. Each Employer shall adopt a program for:
(1) harassment prevention training; (2) reporting of misconduct; (3) investigation of reported
misconduct; and, (4) remedial action.
With respect to training and prevention the Employer shall remind covered employees at
the outset of employment of the availability of harassment prevention training available through
Contract Services Administration Trust Fund and the IATSE Training Trust, or other training as
mutually agreed by the Union and the Employer from time to time.
With respect to reporting and prevention, each Employer shall establish and publish to
the entire crew and cast (subject to the bargaining rights any other union may have) with each
employee’s start paperwork, the Employer’s sexual harassment and abusive conduct prevention
policy compliant with applicable law, and shall include information and practical guidance
regarding the federal and state statutory provisions concerning the prohibition against and the
5

prevention and correction of sexual harassment and remedies available to victims of sexual
harassment in employment.
Employers shall establish multiple avenues to report harassment or abusive conduct that
shall include internal reporting procedures, to the employees’ supervisor(s) the First Assistant
Director, or responsible safety officer, or an appropriate outside reporting services, including but
not limited to The Hollywood Commission or other third-party providers that provide similar
services. The Employer shall notify the Union of any selected third-party provider. No report to
the Union or IATSE Safety Hot Line shall be deemed a report to the Employer unless and until
the Union advises the Employer of the complaint. Both the Union and the Employer are
encouraged to advise covered crew members of the services available through the WIF Help
Line and The Hollywood Commission.
The Employer shall conduct an appropriate investigation of any complaint received
hereunder. In any investigation where a covered employee is either the complainant or the
subject of the investigation, the Union shall be notified of the person engaged to conduct the
investigation. In such cases, the covered employee(s) and the Union shall be advised of the
outcome of the investigation.
Upon a determination that sexual harassment or abusive conduct has occurred, the
Employer shall implement remedial action intended to ensure that such conduct does not recur.
The Union may file on behalf of a covered employee a grievance if the employee contends that
the remedial action is ineffective in ensuring that the conduct does not recur. However, no such
grievance shall be subject to arbitration.
The parties agree to formulation of a sub-committee to work with The Hollywood
Commission regarding the Respect on Set program with a goal of creating a program to be
implemented in subsequent Low Budget Theatrical Agreement negotiations.
Except for discrimination claims brought by employees who have no other federal, state,
or local statutory remedy, claims alleging a violation of this “No Discrimination, Harassment or
Abusive Conduct” provision are not subject to arbitration. Claims under this provision brought
by employees that do not have a federal, state or local statutory remedy shall be subject to the
grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement and shall apply California law with
respect to the arbitration of the dispute. As for all other claims alleging a violation of this
provision, non-binding mediation shall be the exclusive contractual remedy. Notwithstanding the
above, the Employer acknowledges that this provision shall in no way constitute a waiver of any
employee’s federal, state or local statutory rights or remedies.
ARTICLE X. NO STRIKE – NO LOCKOUT
During the term of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes, picketing, work stoppages or
disruptive activity by the Union or by an employee, or lockout by the Employer. Employees have
the right to observe and shall not be required to cross any lawful picket line.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Union shall not be barred from engaging in such
concerted activity if the Employer fails to pay the wages earned by employees covered by this

6

Agreement or to remit benefit contributions, and to promptly remedy such material breaches of
this Agreement upon demand by the Union.
ARTICLE XI. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
A.
Any dispute between the Union and the Employer concerning the interpretation
and/or application of this Agreement which cannot be initially resolved between the Union’s
designated representative, including local union representatives authorized by the IATSE and the
Producer, or thereafter cannot be resolved by the IATSE International President or their
designated representative and the Employer’s designated representative, may be submitted to
arbitration by either party for resolution by a final and binding award. If an arbitrator cannot be
mutually selected, then one shall be selected from an arbitration panel obtained from the
American Arbitration Association in the United States and in Canada either party may apply to
the applicable Minister of Labour to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the procedures of the
applicable Provincial or Federal legislation. The arbitrator and parties shall follow the labor
arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in the United States and the applicable
arbitral jurisprudence in Canada. Any claim not reduced to writing and submitted to the other
party within thirty (30) calendar days following the incident giving rise to the claim or within
thirty (30) calendar days after the aggrieved party had a reasonable opportunity to become aware
of the incident, whichever is later, but in no event more than one (1) year after the incident, shall
be deemed to be waived.
B.
The Union shall not be required to utilize the provisions of (A) above if the
Employer fails to pay the wages earned by employees covered by this Agreement or remit
required benefit contributions and fails to promptly remedy such material breaches of this
Agreement on demand by the Union and the Union may pursue any and all remedies available in
law or equity.
ARTICLE XII.

MULTI-EMPLOYER UNIT

Notwithstanding the geographical scope of this Agreement, the employees hired by the
Employer to perform services in the County of Los Angeles, or hired by the Employer in the
County of Los Angeles to perform services outside the County of Los Angeles shall be deemed
to be within the multi-employer bargaining unit established by the Producer - IATSE 2021 Basic
Agreement and its successor agreements (“BA”) and specifically subject to the BA’s provisions
covering the Industry Experience Roster (Article IX), Health and Pension Plans, including the
Individual Account Plan (Articles XII, XIII, XIIIA, XIV, XIX, and XXVIII), and the Contract
Services Administration Trust Fund (Articles XXV and XXVI); provided, however, the wages,
working conditions and other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be fully applicable to
employees covered by this Agreement. Furthermore, the sideletter to the BA covering the
exhibition of motion pictures transmitted via new media shall be applicable to motion pictures
subject to this Agreement.
ARTICLE XIII.

PREFERENCE OF EMPLOYMENT

A.
In hiring persons within the geographic area covered by Article XII, which
provisions are fully applicable under this Agreement, the Employer will adhere to the provisions

7

of Article IX of the IATSE Basic Agreement and Article 68 of the Local Agreements pertaining
to seniority and eligibility for employment; provided, however, that individuals otherwise
entitled to preference who are not willing to work for the rates and conditions established by this
Agreement shall be deemed “unavailable” and the employer may then hire from any source.
Further, the Union, through its affiliated local unions, will initiate procedures to provide the
Employer on a timely basis with the names of individuals entitled to preference who will work
for the minimum rates and conditions established by this Agreement.
B.
Camera department personnel, other than those based in Los Angeles, who are
covered by the agreement for thirty (30) days or more in a two (2) year period may, upon
application to the Contract Services Administration Trust Fund (“CSATF”), have their names
added to the industry experience roster established under the Producer-IATSE Basic Agreement.
The employee shall have the burden of establishing their eligibility for such industry experience
roster placement subject to the then current rules and procedures applicable to such placement.
C.
Except where the Industry Experience Roster applies, the Employer will give first
consideration to qualified persons referred by local union affiliates of the IATSE located in the
geographic area of a covered production.
D.
Notwithstanding the above, the Employer may employ one (1) person per
production from a bona fide industry training program at the rate applicable to their
classification, in consultation with the affected local union.
E.
When hiring employees for non-rostered crafts, the Employer shall give first
consideration to qualified persons referred by Local Union affiliates.
F.
A First Aid Person shall be employed and present on days when construction
occurs, on production days, and when reasonably required.
ARTICLE XIV.

TITLE CREDITS

Title credits may be given to all department heads and key employees in accordance with
standard industry practice. The form in which screen credits are given need not conform to an
employee’s classification and no presumptions shall flow from the form of such credit. The
Employer shall give title credit to the IATSE by displaying its official seal in accordance with
standard industry practice.
ARTICLE XV.

MINIMUM TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The wage scales and working condition provisions of this Agreement shall be minimums
and employees shall not be precluded from obtaining “better conditions” as that term is
understood in the motion picture industry. Any employee enjoying such better conditions shall
not have their wages or working conditions reduced as a consequence of this Agreement.

8

ARTICLE XVI.

ASSISTANCE/INTERCHANGE

A.
Where the grip, property and electric departments have been staffed by a
department head, assistant and a Journeyperson, they and others within said departments may
assist each other in the performance of the respective duties of said departments.
B.
The parties recognize the importance of adequate staffing of the sound
department. In accordance with the foregoing, in the event an employer elects to utilize a sound
department consisting of fewer than three people, the Sound Mixer’s recommendations with
respect to staffing of the sound department shall be considered in good faith.
ARTICLE XVII.

WORK DAY, WEEK AND MINIMUM CALLS

A.
The work week shall be any five (5) or six (6) consecutive work days within
seven (7) consecutive days. The work week may be shifted two (2) times without incurring
additional costs during principal photography. The foregoing applies to both the main unit and
any second unit independently and such units’ work week weeks need not be identical or
simultaneously shifted. Reasonable advance notice shall be given of any work week shift which
shall be subject to a minimum thirty-two (32) hour rest period and there must be at least one full
work week between shifts. A “round trip” shift in workweek counts as a single workweek shift
under this Article.
B.
The minimum daily work call during pre-production and production shall be eight
(8) hours excluding meals. Work time begins at the time of the set call and ends at the time of set
dismissal. The minimum call on a travel only day shall be four (4) hours and the maximum shall
be eight (8) hours paid as a straight time allowance. On a day when an employee is required to
both work and travel, all hours such day shall be considered work hours.
C.
Call times must be issued before an employee has been dismissed for the day. The
Employer may issue call times at general crew wrap to any employee dismissed earlier than the
rest of the crew.
ARTICLE XVIII.

OVERTIME

A.
The first eight (8) work hours during the first five (5) days of a work week shall
be at straight time. Work hours in excess of eight (8) on the first five (5) days of the work week
and on a sixth work day shall be paid at time and one-half. Double time shall be paid on the first
six (6) work days of the work week and for all hours worked on a seventh work day in a work
week or on a designated holiday in the following manner:
1.
2.

From February 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024
a.
After thirteen (13) hours worked.
Beginning on January 1, 2025
a.
After twelve (12) hours worked.

B.
In order to discourage excessively long work days, work hours beyond fifteen
(15) on any day shall be paid at triple time.

9

C.
All time is to be computed in one-tenth (1/10) hourly units and overtime
premiums shall not be compounded.
ARTICLE XIX.

REST PERIODS

There shall be a ten (10) hour rest period from set wrap to set call for both on and off
production personnel except as otherwise provided in Article XXI. There will be a fifty-two hour
(52) hour rest period following a five (5) day work week and a thirty-two (32) hour rest period
following a six (6) day work week. There will be a thirty-two (32) hour rest period preceding the
sixth (6th) work day when occurring on the seventh (7th) day of the work week. If the full rest
period is not provided, then the employee shall be paid on return to work at the applicable base
rate or overtime rate, plus an additional hour of straight time, for all invaded hours or portion
thereof if at least eight (8) hours of rest has been provided, or for all hours worked if less than
eight (8) hours of rest is provided until a ten (10) hour rest period is provided.
In the event that an employee works more than fourteen (14) hours on two (2)
consecutive days, if the required rest period is invaded following the employee’s dismissal on the
second consecutive day so worked, the employee shall return at their rate in effect at the time of
dismissal, plus an additional hour at straight time, for all such invaded hours.
After seven (7) consecutive days of work, or after a sixth (6th) day of work on the seventh
(7th) day in a workweek, an employee will receive a twelve (12) hour rest period.
Measurement of the weekend rest period shall be on a “set-to-set” or a “worksite-toworksite” basis. The penalty for invading the weekend rest period shall be payment of additional
straight time for all invaded hours only; provided, however, in the event the weekend rest period
is invaded by a partial hour, a full hour of pay of additional straight time shall be due.
ARTICLE XX.

MEALS

A.
Meal periods shall not be less than one-half (½) hour nor more than one (1) hour
in length. Not more than one (1) meal period shall be deducted from work time for an employee
during the minimum call. (A second meal period may be deducted from work time for those
employees who work in excess of the minimum call.) When the Employer furnishes meals, they
shall be appropriate for the time of day and shall not be “fast food” with limited dietary options.
B.
The employee’s first meal period should commence within six (6) hours following
the time of the first call for the day; succeeding meal periods shall commence within six (6)
hours after the end of the proceeding meal period. An employee’s first meal period shall
commence no earlier than three (3) hours after such employee reports for work except for
persons called in earlier than the regular crew call who are provided with a hot non-deductible
breakfast (within one (1) hour before or after the regular crew call) in which case their first
deductible meal period will be due at the same time as the meal is due for the regular crew.
Employees receiving a non-deductible breakfast shall be provided up to thirty (30) minutes for
such meal.
C.
The first deductible meal period may be extended by fifteen (15) minutes to
complete a set up and a second deductible meal period may be extended by thirty (30) minutes to
10

complete a set up and/or wrap. Extensions of the meal periods are not to be scheduled and, if
exceeded, meal penalties shall relate back to the time the meal was otherwise due. Any second
meal, excluding a non-deductible breakfast, may be a non-deductible walking meal, provided
each employee is given a reasonable opportunity to eat and is dismissed within two (2) hours
from the time the meal was otherwise due. With respect to all non-deductible meals, the
employee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to eat.
D.

A meal penalty allowance for delayed meals shall be computed as follows:
(1)
First one-half hour meal delay or fraction thereof ..........................$8.50
(2)
Second one-half hour meal delay or fraction thereof.................... $11.00
(3)
Third and fourth one-half hour meal delay or fraction
thereof ...........................................................................................$13.50
(4)

Fifth and each succeeding one-half hour meal delay or fraction
thereof……………………………………………………………$18.00

After twenty (20) meal penalties in a workweek, employees will be paid one (1)
hour of pay at the straight time rate for each one-half (1/2) hour delay, which in no event shall be
less than $20 per penalty.
Such allowance shall be in addition to the compensation for work time during the
delay and shall not be applied as part of any guarantee.
E.
When an Employer furnishes meals to a shooting unit, and an “off production”
crew is working on the same site at the same time for the same production, the Employer will
either furnish meals to the “off production” crew or pay the “off production” crew a meal
allowance. Payments of per diem to an employee shall be deemed to satisfy the meal allowance
obligation.
F.
Contingent upon approval by two-third (2/3) majority vote by secret ballot of the
IATSE represented crew supervised by a representative of the affected Local Unions, the
Employer may institute an alternative meals system consisting of:
(1)
An eleven (11) hour period of elapsed time commencing with a one (1)
hour paid meal period prior to the general crew call during which no work shall be
performed, and ending at crew wrap (“truck wrap”). If the Employer schedules an
employee for a pre-call, they may receive either the non-deductible one (1) hour paid
meal period, or a one-half (½) hour paid meal period prior to the general crew call and two
(2) fifteen (15) minute paid breaks during the (10) hour period of work. For all
employees, there shall be a guarantee of eleven (11) hours of pay.
(2)
Overtime for work performed on the first five (5) work days worked in a
work week shall be paid as follows, calculated from the earlier of the start of the one (1)
hour paid meal period prior to the general crew call or individual employee’s pre-call:
a.

Work performed after eight (8) elapsed hours shall be paid for at
one and one-half (1.5) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay;

11

b.

Two (2) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay shall be paid
after eleven (11) elapsed hours;

c.

Two and one-half (2.5) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be
paid after twelve (12) elapsed hours;

d.

Three (3) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be paid after
fourteen (14) elapsed hours.

(3)
Paid travel time for employees on distant location shall be paid at the
appropriate premium rate, if any. Such travel time shall not accrue additional meal
penalties if not already triggered as provided in subparagraph (5) below.
(4)
Meal penalties as provided under this Agreement shall apply if work
continues past eleven (11) hours of elapsed time commencing with the general crew call,
in which case meal penalties shall be paid commencing at the end of the sixth (6th) hour
from the conclusion of the one (1) hour paid meal period, or the one-half (1/2) hour meal
period as set forth in subparagraph (1) above. This provision shall also be applicable to a
sixth and/or seventh day worked in a work week.
(5)
If the Employer schedules an employee for a pre-call, they must receive
the non-deductible one (1) hour paid meal period, or the one-half (½) hour paid meal
period and two (2) fifteen (15) minute paid breaks as set forth in subparagraph (1) above
in order to avoid the triggering of meal penalties under this Agreement. Overtime shall be
calculated from individual call times for travel or pre-calls.
(6)
Work performed on a sixth day worked in a work week shall be paid as
follows, calculated from the earlier of the start of the one (1) hour paid meal prior to the
general crew call or individual employee’s pre-call:
a.

One and one-half (1.5) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay
shall be paid for the first eight (8) elapsed hours on a sixth day
worked in a work week;

b.

Work performed after eight (8) elapsed hours shall be paid for at
two (2) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay;

c.

Two and one-half (2.5) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be
paid after eleven (11) elapsed hours;

d.

Three (3) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be paid after
twelve (12) elapsed hours.

(7)
Work performed on a seventh day or holiday worked in a work week shall
be paid as follows, calculated from the earlier of the start of the one (1) hour paid meal
prior to the general crew call or individual employee’s pre-call:

12

a.

Two (2) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay shall be paid for
the first eight (8) elapsed hours on a seventh day worked in a work
week;

b.

Work performed after eight (8) elapsed hours shall be paid for at
two and one-half (2.5) times the regular basic hourly rate of pay;

c.

Three (3) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be paid after
eleven (11) elapsed hours;

d.

Four (4) times the regular hourly rate of pay shall be paid after
twelve (12) elapsed hours.

(8)
On all days, the Employer will provide a continuing hot buffet,
appropriate to the time of day, to the employee. Departments will break their employees
in rotation, so that all will have an opportunity to eat while work continues.
Employer will advise the employees of the designated period of when food is
available on the call sheet. An employee who has not been provided an opportunity to eat
must notify the assistant director at least one (1) hour before the end of the designated
period where food is available.
(9)
In the event a crew member does not have an opportunity to eat a meal
within ten (10) hours the general crew call, they will be entitled to meal penalties
calculated from their 6th hour of work to the wrap of camera.
(10) This alternative meals system may be rescinded with twenty-four (24)
hours notice by a majority vote of the IATSE represented crew.
ARTICLE XXI.

LOCATIONS/TRAVEL

A.
Employees shall report to work at designated local production locations within a
circular thirty (30) mile zone, the radius of which is the Employer’s production office, unless
there are access difficulties, in which case the Employer will make appropriate transportation
arrangements. On any day in which an employee reports to any production location and who
works in excess of fourteen (14) work hours, the employee will be offered either, at the
Employer’s discretion, transportation home and back to work the next day or hotel
accommodations.
B.
The thirty (30) mile zone in Los Angeles shall be measured from the intersection
of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard, and include Agua Dulce, Castaic (including
Lake Castaic), Leo Carillo State Beach, Ontario International Airport, Piru and Pomona
(including the Los Angeles County Fair Grounds.) The Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., Conejo
Ranch property shall be considered as within the studio zone. In New York City, the thirty (30)
mile zone shall be measured from Columbus Circle.
C.

In the New York metropolitan area, the daily rest period starts and ends:

13

(1) For Employees Reporting to a Location in the Thirty (30) Mile Columbus Circle
Zone, Within the Area Bounded by 125th Street and the Battery
In the New York metropolitan area, when an employee is required to report to a location
within the 30-mile Columbus Circle Zone, and within the area bounded by 125th Street and the
Battery, the daily rest period shall commence at the time of dismissal at the location and, if called
to work by the same Employer at a similar zone location the following day, end at the call time
for the next day.
(2) For Employees Reporting to a Location Within the Thirty (30) Mile Columbus Circle
Zone, But Outside the Area Bounded by 125th Street and the Battery
In the New York metropolitan area, if an employee is required to report to a location
outside the area between 125th Street and the Battery, the rest period shall be deemed to
commence at the time that results when the amount of time required for the employee to travel
from such location back to either a mutually-agreed upon point in the area bounded by 125th
Street and the Battery or to the perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery is
added to the employee’s dismissal time.
In the New York Metropolitan area, if an employee is required to work at a location
outside the area between 125th Street and the Battery the next day, then the rest period ends
when the amount of time required for the employee to travel from either a mutually-agreed upon
point in the area bounded by 125th and the Battery or from the perimeter of the area bounded by
125th Street and the Battery to the location is subtracted from the employee’s call time.
For example, suppose an employee is required to report to Newark. The employee is
dismissed from work at 9:00 p.m. Suppose the agreed-upon travel time from Newark to reach the
perimeter of the area between 125th Street and the Battery is one-half hour. The employee’s daily
rest period begins at 9:30 p.m. When the employee is required to report to Newark to work for
the same Employer the following day, the employee’s call time may not be earlier than 8:00 a.m.
to avoid an invasion of the ten (10) hour daily rest period.
(3) For Employees Reporting to a Studio
In the New York metropolitan area, when an employee is required to report to a studio
located within the 30-mile Columbus Circle Zone, the daily rest period shall commence at the
time of dismissal at the studio and, if called to work at the studio by the same Employer the
following day, end at the call time for the next day.
(4) For Employees Reporting to Work on Nearby Locations
In the New York metropolitan area, if an employee is required to report to a nearby
location outside the 30-mile Columbus Circle Zone, then the daily rest period shall be deemed to
commence at the time that results when the amount of time required for the employee to travel
from the location to either a mutually agreed upon point in the area bounded by 125th Street and
the Battery or to the perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery is added to
the employee’s dismissal time and ends when the amount of time required for the employee to
travel from a mutually-agreed upon point in the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery or
14

from the perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery to the location is
subtracted from the employee’s call time, if called to work by the same Employer at a nearby
location on the following day.
For example, suppose an employee is required to report to Newark. The employee is
dismissed from work at 7:00 p.m. Suppose it takes one-half hour of travel from Newark to reach
the perimeter of the area between 125th Street and the Battery. The employee’s rest period begins
at 7:30 p.m. Suppose the employee is required to report to Newark for the same Producer the
following day at 7:00 a.m. The employee’s rest period ends at 6:30 a.m.
(5) A designated representative of the Employer and a designated representative of the
Union shall determine the amount of time needed to travel between the location and either the
mutually-agreed upon point within the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery or the
perimeter of the area bounded by 125th Street and the Battery. In the event of a dispute, the
matter shall be referred to the employees’ bargaining representative and to the Labor Relations
representative of the Employer for resolution.
D.
The provisions in Article XXI.C. shall not apply when the production office is
outside of the New York City thirty (30) mile zone measured from Columbus Circle.
E.
When an employee is required to transport themselves between production
locations, they shall be paid a mileage allowance for such travel at the applicable IRS or CRA
rate unless they are being provided with a reasonable car allowance. All mileage calculations are
to be based on the shortest “driveable” route.
F.
Employees may be requested to report to a production location outside the thirty
(30) mile zone, in which case the employee shall be paid all transportation costs, including
mileage, computed from the perimeter to the distance from the thirty (30) mile zone to the
reporting place and return calculated at the current IRS allowable rate in the U.S. and the current
CRA allowable reimbursement rate in Canada. Such travel time outside of the thirty (30) mile
zone shall be paid as an allowance at the employee’s regular hourly rate and such travel time
shall not accrue toward the required rest period.
G.
Any employee whose primary residence is more than sixty (60) miles from a
production location shall be provided with a per diem allowance and either housing or a housing
allowance. Prior to travel, the employer shall notify employees of arrangements for cashing per
diem allowance checks. Employees may be provided coach-class air transportation to and from
an overnight location. Housing provided by the Employer shall be single bedroom housing if
available. The per diem allowance shall be as follows:
Breakfast .............................................$12.00
Lunch ..................................................$16.00
Dinner .................................................$32.00
Any meals provided by the Employer may be deducted from the per diem at the
above stated rates.

15

H.
The Employer shall request employees to sign a written statement attesting to
their principal residency. A false statement of residency may result in immediate discharge. The
Employer shall notify the IATSE if an employee refuses to sign a written statement of residency.
I.
Work time for employees on overnight location, including distant hires under
Article XXI (E), shall be calculated on a portal-to-portal basis and they shall be provided with
transportation to and from the daily production location. Rest periods shall be calculated on a
portal-to-portal basis when working inside the zone as set forth above. In the event Distant Hire
elects lodging other than at Employer’s primary housing location(s), portal-to-portal work time
shall be calculated to and from the primary housing location of a production and the daily
production location.
J.
On any day in which an employee reports to any production location outside the
local 30 mile production zone described above and whose work and travel time from the edge of
zone exceeds fourteen (14) hours, the employee will be offered either, at the Employer’s
discretion, transportation home and back to work the next day or hotel accommodations.
K.
For each sixth or seventh day not worked on distant locations the following shall
apply: (1) on Ultra Low and Tier One A productions as defined in Article I above, the employee
shall receive an amount equivalent to an extra one (1) day’s per diem and the Employer shall
make pension and health contributions for four (4) hours for those employees subject to Article
XII hereof or an amount equivalent to one half (1/2) of the daily benefit contribution amount
applicable to each individual employee on distant location who is not subject to Article XII
hereof; (2) on Tier One B productions as defined in Article I above, the employee shall receive
an amount equivalent to an extra one (1) day’s per diem and the Employer shall make pension
and health contributions for eight (8) hours for those employees subject to Article XII hereof or
an amount equivalent to one (1) day’s benefit contribution amount applicable to each individual
employee on distant location who is not subject to Article XII hereof; or (3) on Tier Two and Tier
Three productions as defined in Article I above, the employee on distant location shall be paid
four (4) hours of straight time at the wage rates applicable to such employee plus pension and
health contributions for eight (8) hours or at the daily contribution rate, whichever is applicable,
for each idle sixth or seventh day. No more than two (2) idle days shall be permitted in a
workweek, except as a result of a workweek shift pursuant to Article XVII(A). The foregoing
shall not apply to “on call” employees subject to Article XII and the provisions of the BA
establish the basis of benefit contributions for 6th and 7th days on distant location.
L.
If the Employer replaces a Distant Hire with a Local Hire, in order to avoid the
costs associated with the Distant Hire employee being on overnight location, it shall either give
one (1) week notice to the Distant Hire of the replacement or, if such Distant Hire is replaced
prior to receiving one (1) week notice, the Employer shall pay for the Distant Hire the balance
cost of housing for such Distant Hire plus per diem that the Distant Hire would have received
had they continued working for a full one (1) week notice period.
ARTICLE XXII.

CANCELLATION/CHANGE OF CALLS

A.
In the event of a cancellation of a call, if notification is not given by 5:00 p.m. of
the previous day’s work, then the employee shall be paid an eight (8) hour minimum call unless

16

the cancelled call was for travel only, in which case the employee shall be paid a four (4) hour
minimum call. For employees who are not yet on the Employer’s payroll, such work call cannot
be cancelled.
B.
Calls may be changed for current employees by 8:00 p.m. the day preceding the
call, or with six (6) hours’ notice on the day of the call, provided such notice is given after 7:00
a.m.; in addition, calls may be pushed to a later hour as long as employees receive at least nine
(9) hours’ notice.
C.
The Employer may issue a “weather-permitting” call for extreme heat, extreme
cold, extreme wind, lightning, snow, sleet, ice storms, fire hazard as identified by the National
Weather Service, smoke conditions or hurricanes to employees prior to their dismissal for the day
and to persons not on payroll up to twelve (12) hours before their call time (even if a call had
previously been given). The Employer shall provide notice to the Union upon the issuance of a
“weather-permitting” call. The Employer may cancel a “weather-permitting” call up to four (4)
hours prior to the call time.
In the event a daily employee is notified not to report to work, they shall be paid
four (4) hours of pay at straight time, and the Employer shall contribute one-third (1/3) of the
daily amount due under Article XXIV, or, for employees receiving MPIPHP contributions, four
(4) hours of benefit contributions; however, if the notification to the daily employee is untimely,
the daily employee shall be paid for an eight (8) hour minimum call.
In the event an “on call” employee is notified not to report to work, they shall be
paid one-half (½) of one-fifth (1/5) of his or her weekly rate, and the Employer shall contribute
one-third (1/3) of the amount due under Article XXIV, or, for employees receiving MPIPHP
contributions, four (4) hours of benefit contributions; however, if the notification to the “on call”
employee is untimely, or the Employer authorizes the “on call” employee to work that day, the
“on call” employee shall be paid for the day.
The foregoing is in addition to the Employer’s rights under the Article XXII(D)
below. The Union agrees that it will not unreasonably deny a request by the Employer to issue a
“weather-permitting” call under this paragraph for other weather conditions.
D.
Notwithstanding the above, the Employer may cancel calls due to inclement
weather (extreme heat, extreme cold, extreme wind, lightning, snow, sleet, ice storms, fire hazard
as identified by the National Weather Service, smoke conditions or hurricanes), provided that the
Employer provides notice to the Union as soon as practicable. The employees must be notified of
the cancellation no later than 8:00 p.m. the night before the call. This provision shall also be
applicable to calls for the first day of a new workweek (e.g., Monday) so long as the Employer
makes the effort to inform employees on the last day of the preceding workweek (i.e., Friday in
the case of a Monday call) of the possibility that the call will be cancelled and the employee is
notified of the cancellation before 8:00 p.m. on the evening prior to the call (i.e., Sunday in the
case of a Monday call.) The Union agrees that it will not unreasonably deny a request by the
Employer to cancel a call under this subparagraph (D) due to other weather conditions.

17

ARTICLE XXIII.

HOLIDAYS

A.
The following shall be recognized as holidays: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther
King, Jr. Day, Presidents’ Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,
Thanksgiving Day, the day after Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day. Holidays are to be celebrated
on the day they are officially celebrated, except when recognized on a different day under the
Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement in which case they will be celebrated on the
same day. Weekly employees and those on distant location shall be paid for an unworked holiday
falling within their regular work week. A weekly employee shall not be converted to a daily
employee for the purpose of evading the holiday obligation under this paragraph.
The Employer agrees to add Juneteenth as a holiday in the event the AMPTP agrees to
add that holiday to any of the IATSE Basic Agreement, the IATSE Area Standards Agreement,
the Directors Guild of America Basic Agreement, or its television/theatrical agreement with
SAG-AFTRA.
B.
For work performed in Canada, Employer may elect to observe the following
Canadian holidays in lieu of the referenced holidays in this Article:
1.
Victoria Day in lieu of Memorial Day; and
2.
Canada Day in lieu of Independence Day (July 4th);
provided that the two holidays are within the employee’s period of employment and the
Employer gives no less than two (2) weeks’ notice to the affected employee, unless the employee
has been employed fewer than two (2) weeks prior to the first of the two holidays, in which case
the Employer will provide notice to the affected employee at the time of hire. When the
employee has not been employed on the Canadian holiday set forth above, but is employed to
work on the U.S. holiday, the employee shall be paid a premium for the corresponding U.S.
holiday.
The Union will not unreasonably deny requests to exchange other Canadian
holidays for those listed in this Article (such as Family Day in lieu of Presidents’ Day or Easter
Monday in lieu of Good Friday).
ARTICLE XXIV.

include the IATSE National Pension Fund, the IATSE National Health and Welfare Fund, and the
IATSE Annuity Fund. The Union may, upon ten (10) days written notice to the Employer, modify
the allocation formula. The Union will make its best effort to provide such notice prior to the
commencement of production.
H.
For those jurisdictions not otherwise referenced that have their own benefit plans,
the IATSE shall notify the Employer of the allocation into such plans.
I.
The Employer will execute any documents required to constitute it an appropriate
Employer contributor to any of the foregoing benefit plans.
ARTICLE XXV.

BEREAVEMENT LEAVE

In the event of the death of a parent, step parent, grandparent, grandchild, sibling, step
sibling, spouse, child, or step child of an eligible employee, such employee shall be allowed up
to three paid days off and their job shall be available upon return from bereavement leave.
Employees who work fifty percent (50%) or more of the total work days of their department
shall be deemed eligible for bereavement leave pay. Payment for bereavement leave may be
deferred until the Employer can determine the employee’s eligibility. Bereavement pay shall be
calculated on the same basis as unworked holidays.
ARTICLE XXVI.

VOLUNTARY POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

The Employer agrees to deduct from each employee’s gross wages at each payroll period
such voluntary contributions to the IATSE Political Action Committee (“IATSE PAC”) as the
employee has authorized in writing to be deducted. At least once a month, the Employer will
issue a single check for deductions payable to the IATSE PAC and remit same directly to the
IATSE PAC. Along with the check, the Employer will provide the PAC with the following
information: (1) the name of each employee for whom a deduction has been made, (2) the
20

employee’s social security number, and (3) the amount of the deduction. Employees who wish to
cancel or modify their deduction will sign a card supplied by the Union for such purpose. The
Union will be responsible for obtaining any refund from the IATSE PAC. The Union will
reimburse the Employer annually for all actual costs incurred in administering this deduction and
will indemnify and hold harmless the Employer from any and all liability arising from
deductions provided for in this section. Administration of the foregoing may be assigned to the
Employer’s payroll service. This Article shall not be operative in Canada unless and until the
IATSE establishes a PAC in compliance with Canadian law.
ARTICLE XXVII.

401(K) PLANS

If an employee covered by this Agreement is eligible to participate in an IRS Qualified
401(k) Plan sponsored by the IATSE or an IATSE Local Union, the Employer will honor the
written authorization of such employee to deduct from the employee’s gross wages the specified
eligible amount to be remitted to such 401(k) Plan. Either the Local Union sponsoring such
401(k) Plan or the Plan Administrator shall confirm in writing that employees are eligible to
participate and shall provide any other information relevant to the proper administration of
authorized employee contributions to the Employer or its designated payroll service who may be
assigned administrative responsibility for this provision.
ARTICLE XXVIII.

PAYROLL DEPOSIT

A.
In situations where the Union has reason to be concerned over the financial
viability of a signatory Employer to this Agreement, other than a signatory to its predecessor, or
where a signatory to this Agreement or its predecessor has not met its financial obligations, in
order to secure performance, the following shall be applicable:
(1)

The Union may require the Employer to deposit with the Union (or payroll
service approved by the Union) an amount equal to the two highest
budgeted payroll weeks of estimated payroll and fringe benefit
contributions for covered employees. Such amount shall be reduced by
consent of the Union upon completion of principal photography to an
amount appropriate for post production and released upon completion of
post production and verification by the Union that all contractual
obligations have been met by the Employer.

(2)

Deposited amounts may only be drawn upon for the sole purpose of
satisfying amounts owed to covered employees under this Agreement. If
the Employer and the Union agree on such amounts, the Employer shall
authorize release of payment(s) to the employee(s) within two (2) weeks
of such agreement.

(3)

In the event a payroll service is to be utilized to hold and/or guarantee the
deposit, the Employer shall provide the Union with written verification of
the payroll service’s consent to do so which must be executed by the
payroll service.

21

The applicable minimum wage rates for positions covered by this Agreement are
set forth in Appendices A, B, C, and D attached. Specifically, as set forth in Appendices A, B, C,
and D attached, there shall be various minimum rates of compensation applicable to productions
having production costs within the budget Tiers specified in Article I hereof. There are no
guarantees of employment beyond one (1) day for daily employees and one (1) week for weekly
employees. For any employee who has or will be employed for more than one complete work
week, partial work weeks at the beginning and the end of that employee’s assignment may be
prorated at the rate of one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly rate for each workday for the partial work
week. The guaranteed pay of weekly employees who absent themselves without Employer’s
consent may be reduced one-fifth (1/5) of the weekly guarantee for each day of absence.
B.
With respect to an “Ultra Low Budget Film”, one with at least fifteen days of
scheduled principal photography whose production costs do not exceed two million and sevenhundred fifty thousand dollars ($3,000,000) as budgeted, the wage rates for covered employees
shall be as negotiated with such an employee provided however they shall be at rates not less
than one-hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the applicable statutory minimum wage (in no
event shall this result in an hourly rate less than $13 an hour in year one of the Agreement, $14
an hour in year two, and $15 an hour in year three) and overtime shall be computed and paid in
compliance with applicable law. Evidence of a pattern or practice of wage payments not meeting
the foregoing standards shall entitle all covered employees on the film to an adjustment to the
then current Tier Two minimum wage rates and working conditions retroactive to each covered
employees’ first day of employment.
C.
If an employee works continuously for two (2) or more hours in a higher
classification with appropriate authorization, the rate of the higher classification shall be
applicable for the entire day.

Wages must be paid to employees no later than the Friday following the end of
each production work week.
E.

minimum scale per day and shall not be less than two (2) work days. Pay for timing is in addition
to, and separate from, preparation pay.

Supervisor shall be paid a $40 flat sum for each such day.

employee may seek assistance from the Business Representative of the Local Union in
connection with these negotiations, provided that there is no delay to the production in doing so.
The Business Representative need not be present for the negotiations.
C.
If an employee is required to sign a waiver for any state or governmental agency
or owner of private property and refuses to sign such a waiver, such employee may be replaced,

fifteen (15) feet or more in water using a diving mask, air helmet or diving suit, including skin
diving, will be paid an allowance of forty dollars ($40.00) for each dive with a maximum
payment in a single shift of one hundred twenty dollars ($120.00). Such allowance shall

(3)
A rest period of ten (10) minutes shall be allowed for each hour so
worked. Not more than two (2) consecutive hours shall elapse without a
rest period.
(4)
In the event safety conditions so warrant, it shall be the practice of
underwater workers in the performance of such work to work jointly in
pairs.
(5)
Employer will provide suitable wearing apparel for abnormal cold or wet
work.

23

(6)

Re:

Published Sideletter One to 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement

The following is intended to memorialize agreements and understandings reached
between the parties to the above-referenced Agreement during the course of negotiations.
BASE CAMP POWER & GENERATORS
The parties confirmed that the installation, connection and striking of temporary electric
power sources emanating from a location base camp is work within the jurisdiction of the
IATSE.
The operation of generators is within the jurisdiction of the IATSE except where another
labor organization has established jurisdiction with motion picture producers covering such
work. The foregoing is not a staffing requirement.
ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS
The specific inclusion of the publicist, marine coordinator and boat handler
classifications shall not be deemed to preclude continuation of the past practice of industry
employers in securing such services from third party suppliers and subcontractors, provided
however, individuals directly employed to render such services shall be appropriately classified
and subject to the Agreement.
PROMOTIONAL RIGHTS
The parties confirmed that the rights derived from the services of employees performing
their regular duties covered by the Agreement include the right to exploit the proceeds of their
services and their likeness, image or voice in the promotion, marketing or exploitation of the
motion picture. The foregoing does not apply when the likeness, image, or voice appear in the
motion picture itself.
Persons engaged to capture the likeness, image, or voice of employees covered hereunder
in connection with the production of electronic press kits shall be subject to this Agreement;
provided, however, there shall be no preference of employment or limitations on assistance and
interchange. Nothing herein shall limit the subcontracting of the production of electronic press
kits, provided the Employer first notifies the IATSE in writing of its intention to subcontract, and
the direct labor costs of the subcontract are not less than the direct labor costs set forth in this
Agreement, the Videotape Electronics Supplemental Basic Agreement, or other applicable
IATSE collective bargaining agreement.

Re:

Published Sideletter Two to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement

The following is intended to memorialize the agreement and understanding reached
between the parties to the above Agreement during the course of its negotiation.
A Director of Photography (“DP”) and the Producer of the film may request that the DP
be permitted to also function as a Camera Operator. Such request must be made in writing during
the film’s pre-production and directed to the IATSE with a copy to the appropriate Camera Local.
The IATSE shall have the authority to grant such request based upon special needs or
extraordinary circumstances.
The agreement of the DP to operate the camera shall not be a condition of the DP’s
employment and the DP and Producer shall confirm same in their request.
Each party to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement hereby confirms its
agreement with the foregoing by its execution of this Sideletter at the place provided below.

Re:

Published Sideletter Three to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement

During the course of negotiations for the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement
the parties agreed to include the classifications of Location Managers and Assistant Locations
Managers as covered classifications in recognition that the IATSE represents such employees in
numerous geographical locations covered by the Agreement. The parties further agreed that such
recognition did not extend to geographical areas where another labor organization had
established jurisdiction in such areas reflected in agreements with other employers, including but
not limited to New York, Los Angeles, Canada, Georgia, New Mexico and Michigan, and did not
preclude the employment of Location Managers and Assistant Location managers under such
agreements to work in geographical areas where such person, if hired locally, would be subject to
the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement.
Each party to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement hereby confirms it
concurrence with the foregoing by its execution of the Sideletter at the place provided below.

Re:

Published Sideletter Four to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement

The following is intended to memorialize the agreement and understanding reached
between the parties to the above Agreement during the course of its negotiation.
The language in Article X (No Strike, No Lockout) and Article XI (Grievance Procedure)
which relieves the Union of limitations on its ability to engage in concerted activity and only
utilize the grievance procedure in the event an Employer fails to pay wages earned by employees
covered by the Agreement or remit required benefit contributions and fails to promptly remedy
such material breaches of the Agreement upon demand by the Union is intended to apply when
there is a failure to pay the entire IATSE represented crew or a substantial portion thereof or the
failure to remit benefit contributions on behalf of the entire IATSE represented crew or a
substantial portion thereof and not if such failure is limited to a few employees and is attributable
to error, confusion, inadvertence or dispute.
Each party to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement hereby confirms its
agreement with the foregoing by its execution of this Sideletter at the place provided below.

Re:

Extended Workday Safety Guidelines:
It shall be the responsibility of the Employer to ensure that safety standards consistent
with OSHA and prevailing industry safety standards are maintained during the production and
that no unsafe equipment, procedures or practices are allowed on the set or work site. Employees
shall cooperate with the Employer to maintain such safety standards at all times. No employee
shall be discharged or otherwise disciplined for refusing to work on a job that exposes the
individual to a clear and present danger to life and limb. Employer shall refer to CSATF Safety
Bulletins at the following website http://www.csatf.org/bulletintro.shtml.
Motion Picture productions are budgeted for specified hours of production. There are cost
deterrents which encourage the production to be on budget and on time. When an extended work
day is necessary, the need for same should be identified as far in advance as possible so that
appropriate planning may occur.
The following guidelines set forth common sense measures which should be considered
when extended work days are necessitated:
1. Sleep deprivation, which may be caused by factors other than an extended work day,
should be identified by the employee. The American Automobile Association (AAA)
cautions drivers as to the following danger signs:
• Eyes closing by themselves
• Difficulty in paying attention
• Frequent yawning
• Swerving in lane
AAA warns that drivers experiencing any of these danger signs could fall asleep at
any time. AAA recommends three basic solutions – sleep, exercise and caffeine. AAA
urges drivers who are too drowsy to drive safely to pull off the road to a safe area,
lock the doors and take a nap – even twenty minutes will help. Upon waking, the
driver should get some exercise and consume caffeine for an extra boost.
2. Any employee who believes that they are too tired to drive safely should notify an
authorized representative of the Employer before leaving the set. In that event, the
Employer will endeavor to find alternative means of transportation or provide a hotel
room or a place to rest. Such request may be made without any fear of reprisal and
will not affect any future employment opportunities.

3. When the production company anticipates an extended work day, the employees
should be encouraged to car pool.
4. When an extended work day is necessary, appropriate beverages and easily
metabolized foods should be available.
Each party to the 2023-2025 Low Budget Theatrical Agreement hereby confirms its
agreement with the foregoing by its execution of this Sideletter at the place provided below.
